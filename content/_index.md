## Welcome to my digital garden

There are no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no guests
or sponsored posts, no AI slop, and no paywall.

My motivation for the site is to have a space for self-expression and to share
with the world what I've been learning.

I can only hope this will serve as inspiration to others to leave their own mark
on the web in the uphill battle against the
[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) of the
internet.

If you want to email me, feel free to; _in general_ I will get back to you
(eventually).
