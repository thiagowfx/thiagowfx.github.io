Welcome to my digital garden – a space where I explore technology and
share what I'm learning along the way.

I'm passionate about continuous learning and open-source software. Here, I
document my journey, share insights with genuine self-expression, and dive into
miscellaneous topics that spark my curiosity.

I believe in the power of the Small Web for sharing valuable, distraction-free
content. Want to chat? Send me an email – I'm always up for interesting
conversations and opportunities.

I hope it will inspire you to leave your own mark on the Indie Web too.
