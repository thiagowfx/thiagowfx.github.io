Welcome to my digital garden – a space where I explore technology and
share what I'm learning along the way.

I'm passionate about continuous learning and open-source software. Here, I
document my journey, share insights, and dive into miscellaneous topics that
spark my curiosity. My goal? To carve out a corner of the Web for genuine
self-expression with valuable, distraction-free content.

I believe in the power of the Indie Web for sharing knowledge. Want to chat?
Send me an email – I'm always up for interesting conversations and
opportunities.

This site has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking, sponsored posts, [no Gen AI slop](/ai), and no paywall.

I hope it will inspire you to leave your own mark on the Web too.
