**1**: an aptitude for making {desirable, valuable} discoveries by accident

Welcome to my digital garden – a space where I explore technology and
share what I'm learning along the way.

I'm passionate about continuous learning and open-source software. Here, I
document my journey, share insights with genuine self-expression, and dive into
miscellaneous topics that spark my curiosity.

I believe in the power of the {Indie, Small} Web for sharing valuable, distraction-free
content.
Hopefully this will inspire you to leave your own mark there too.
