## Welcome

Welcome to my digital garden – a space dedicated to exploring technology and
sharing what I've been learning.

This site reflects my passion for continuous learning and open-source software,
wherein I document my journey, offer insights, and dive into miscellaneous
topics that reflect my interest. My goal is to maintain a corner of the Web for
self-expression focused on valuable, distraction-free content.

I believe in the power of the Open Web as a platform for sharing knowledge. If
you'd like to get in touch, feel free to send me an email; I'm always open to
interesting conversations and opportunities.

There are no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no guests
or sponsored posts, no AI slop, and no paywall.

I can only hope this will serve as inspiration to others to leave their own mark
on the Web[^2].
