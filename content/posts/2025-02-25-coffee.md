Coffee is a bitter liquid that turns brain synapses into computer code.

A productive day[^1] in the life:

- Morning: [Aeropressed](https://aeropress.com/) coffee. An artifact I very much
  love, an acquired taste from Canada.
- Morning (v2): A self-made espresso. With love and fondness. No wonder the
  Italians are happy people.
- Afternoon: Filter coffee. From an ordinary coffee machine. With specialty
  coffee from Brazil.
- Afternoon (v2): A cappuccino. You can only truly appreciate one after you
  learn how to properly spell and pronounce it[^2].


[^1]: No one said it's a _typical_ day. Interpretation is always left open to
    the reader.

[^2]: A bit easier when you incorporate [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) in
    your digital life. Aaah, pastel.
