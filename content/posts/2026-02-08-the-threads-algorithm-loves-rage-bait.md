This is an exemplary situation illustrating why running a personal blog is
simply much nicer than jumping the social media bandwagon.

Comments received via email tend to be much higher-quality than social media
replies.

And I am not even calling out any particular companies. It's just the inherent
atmosphere of these platforms.

That said I am still debating whether to create a public Mastodon profile
associated with my public web persona.
