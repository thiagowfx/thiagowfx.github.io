2022 was an amazing year for AIs.


## [ChatGPT][chatgpt]

- [`ChatGPT`][chatgpt] can effectively replace Stack
  Overflow to a large extent, if you learn how to ask questions to it. Example queries that work amazingly, returning exactly what you would expect, with detailed explanation and/or context:

  - PKGBUILD how to specify git version
  - python how to sort list reverse
  - systemd create unit file that forks
  - xorg start i3wm with startx
  - git update all submodules to latest tip
  - typescript make simple post request
  - chromium difference between args and declare_args
  - sekiro versus elden ring
  - generate random number between 10 and 20
    - I cannot run the code. Please generate a random number for me
    - between 10 and 20 though
  - add pasta before or after boiling water?
  - what is the difference between auszahlen and Bargeld abheben?
  - write a trip packing checklist for me

  Someone even wrote a Chrome extension to query `ChatGPT` alongside a Google search: https://github.com/wong2/chat-gpt-google-extension (chatgpt4google.com). I couldn't get it to work for some reason though.

## [Stable Diffusion][stable-diffusion]

Given a query (text), it generates an image for you. It pairs up quite nicely with Slides (when looking for inspiration) and can effectively replace Google Images to some extent.
