[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) made a splash during
the pandemic. By now people became quite accustomed to it, and maybe even bored
somewhat.


[Jumblie](https://jumblie.com/) is somewhat similar, and arguably more
~~difficult~~ challenging. It was created by [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/).
