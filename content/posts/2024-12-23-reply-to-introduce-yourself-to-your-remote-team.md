User guides (go/user-guides) are a great way to introduce yourself to your team
at work. Cassidy notes:

> - Time zones/availability
> - Communication preferences (Slack vs Zoom vs email vs phone vs something else)
> - Things folks might misunderstand about you
> - Things everyone should know
> - How you prefer to get feedback
> - Things that you like to talk about, work-related and non-work-related

The list is already quite comprehensive, however I would also add:

- [Ask vs Guess](https://jeanhsu.substack.com/p/ask-vs-guess-culture)
  preferences
- [MBTI]({{< ref "2024-12-22-mbti" >}})

One caveat is maintenance[^1]. Information could easily get outdated. It's
possible to write your user guide in such a way it represents a snapshot of your
preferences at the time you wrote it, OR as a living document that keeps
evolving as you grow. Adjust expectations clearly. One way to do so is to add a
date to it in case you anticipate information easily getting out-of-date
therein.

Also, why stop there? Set up oneshot 1:1 meetings with your immediate team
members, and then with your extended ones. It doesn't matter whether these
meetings are in-person or virtual. Set up serendipitous meetings with folks
outside of your team[^2]. Some people call these lunch ninjas, others call these
[coffee donuts](https://www.donut.com/). Not everyone may end up accepting your
invitations, but that's perfectly fine! Just move on.


[^1]: As everything else in life...
[^2]: Directors, VP and C-level folks are unlikely to accept your invitations
    though.
