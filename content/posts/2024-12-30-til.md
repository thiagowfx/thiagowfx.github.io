I am a big fan of "TIL" (Today I Learned) blogs.
So much that my own blog is kinda becoming one.

A few people that inspired me, in order, at the time of this publication:

- [Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net/)
- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/til/)
- [David Winterbottom](https://til.codeinthehole.com/posts/)
- [Bruno Alla](https://browniebroke.com/)
- [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/tree/master)

If you are a software developer, consider starting a TIL blog as well.

(And message me with the URL to your RSS feed!)
