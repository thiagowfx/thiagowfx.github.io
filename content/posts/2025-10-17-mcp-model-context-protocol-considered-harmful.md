title: "MCP: model context protocol considered harmful"

[Previously]({{< ref "2025-10-08-claude-code-adding-my-first-mcp-server" >}}).

I configured my [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code)
instance at work to include exactly 3 MCP servers:

- github
- playwright (browser automation / testing)
- atlassian (JIRA, Confluence, etc)

Sensible, right? It's not like I'm a heavy user of MCPs. I mostly care about:

- PR introspection / creation
- occasional unit / integration testing in the browser
- JIRA (read access)

I didn't even have the opportunity to add an MCP for Docker or Kubernetes yet.

And yet:

The Sonnet 4 model has a context window of 200k tokens.

These 3 MCP servers, alone, consume about one third of them. **36%**!

If you account for system tools + the system prompt in the mix, practically half
of the total available context window is already gone.

MCP tool definitions are wasteful, taking valuable ~~real~~ virtual estate,
distracting the model, increasing overall costs.

As [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/14/agentic-engineering/)
already noted from [Peter Steinberger](https://steipete.me/posts/just-talk-to-it):

To me this feels comparable to using a full-blown desktop environment in Linux
Desktop versus rolling your tiling window manager and building from scratch
an environment tailored to your own needs.

Stay safe from the bloat out there.
