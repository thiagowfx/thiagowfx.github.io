Sometimes, when connecting to public Wi-Fi hotposts, especially in airports and
coffee shops, the captive portal gateway required to get internet access will
simply not show up.

The simplest way to force it to do so is to [turn the Wi-Fi off and on
again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqdyoTpyEs).

Should it not work, the second way is to open your favorite browser and navigate
to [captive.apple.com](https://captive.apple.com) (macOS, iOS).
