[Kagi](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company/) is a paid search engine.

The [Kagi Small Web](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web) is:

> the non-commercial part of the web, crafted by individuals to express
> themselves or share knowledge without seeking any financial gain. This concept
> often evokes nostalgia for the early, less commercialized days of the web,
> before the ad-supported business model took over the internet (and we started
> fighting back!)

[Context](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/).

Kagi supports searching websites within the Small Web via a [dedicated
lens](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/lenses.html) (think of it as a search
scope).

They also provide a integrated [RSS
feed](https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed/) (think of it as a "small web
[planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software))").

And, also, a [navigator](https://kagi.com/smallweb) (think of it as StumbleUpon
or Digg in the early days).

The small web somewhat correlates with the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/):

> What is the IndieWeb?
>
> The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the "corporate web".
>
> We are a community of independent and personal websites based on the
> principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online
> identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning
> your content.

It is a great source of serendipity.
