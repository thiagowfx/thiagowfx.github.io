Title says it all.

[Itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/):

> Itsycal is a tiny menu bar calendar.

It's free, it's available via homebrew, it's discrete and elegant.

The only caveat is not the app's fault: iCloud calendar synchronization takes
forever...that's something I should investigate some other day.
