An observation of lately: whenever I blog about software or technologies I'm
unfamiliar with ("learning in the open"), I tend to be more diligent than usual
(i.e. than if I were doing it privately, only for myself).

Because I like to link to documentation and to add references as much as
possible, I tend to adopt a mindset of verifying that my assumptions and the
overall mental model of how things work are true.

IMHO this is a good trait to adopt, which I attribute exclusively to the nature
of public blogging.
