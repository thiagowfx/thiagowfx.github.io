Surely you can afford to be picky[^1] with your code fonts these days.

Don't know where to start? https://www.codingfont.com/ ([via John
Gruber](https://www.codingfont.com/)) is a good start:

> [...] fun “tournament” from Typogram that lets you pick your favorite

[anarcat](https://anarc.at/blog/2024-05-29-playing-with-fonts-again/) also has
some good insights, go read his post. In particular:

- https://www.programmingfonts.org/

Surely there is no shortage of monospaced code font playgrounds to try out! His
post prompted me to try out Commit Mono for a bit.

Now it's your turn, go ahead, pick your ~~poison~~ font, I'll wait.


[^1]: These days I use "IBM Plex Mono" on VSCode. "JetBrains Mono" is also a
    solid choice.
