[yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi):

> ðŸ’¥ Blazing fast terminal file manager written in Rust, based on async I/O.

I tried it for a couple of days and decided it's not worth a switch from
[ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger):

> A VIM-inspired filemanager for the console

Why?

- "written in Rust"â„¢ is never a reason _by itself_ to switch from familiar
  software
- popularity is never a reason _by itself_ to switch from familiar software
  (yazi has 50% more stars than ranger on GitHub)
- their core feature set is essentially the same
- muscle memory wins

Even though it is possible to map keybindings in `yazi` to resemble `ranger`, it
simply didn't feel homy.
[Sorry](https://github.com/thiagowfx/.dotfiles/commit/e2380e52a0d195c5800b4e8dd032c18dcf4f0c51).
