In order to post a large text file to Slack, use a [snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/204145658-Create-or-paste-code-snippets-in-Slack).
Snippet is short for "code snippet".

Type in `/snippet`, then complete the wizard.

You can choose the language – typically YAML, JSON or Shell – for syntax
highlighting.

This is better than dumping the entire source within a pair of three backticks.
