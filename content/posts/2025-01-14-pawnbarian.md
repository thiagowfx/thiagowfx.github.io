[Pawnbarian](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142080/Pawnbarian/) on Steam:

> Pawnbarian is a quick-playing, turn-based puzzle roguelike. Play cards to move
> your hero like a chess piece, and conquer challenging dungeons full of cunning
> monsters!

I really liked its gameplay. It has a clever twist on top of chess, and it's
easy to assimilate.

As a bonus, its soundtrack is superb – visualize what an intermingled hybrid
between [Hitman](https://ioi.dk/hitman) and [Dead
Cells](https://dead-cells.com/) would sound like.
