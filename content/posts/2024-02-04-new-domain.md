I got a new domain! This blog is now available on https://www.perrotta.dev/.
There's also a redirect to it from https://blog.perrotta.dev/.

**Update (2024-12-21)**: The canonical URL is now simply https://perrotta.dev/.


I don't know which one I like best, so `www` is the canonical subdomain for now.
Feel free to update the RSS in your feed reader, although
https://thiagowfx.github.io/ should keep working for a little longer, until (if
ever) I decide to migrate the static hosting off Github Pages.

This is a project I wanted to do since ages ago, and my goals go beyond merely
making my blog available under it. Stay tuned for more updates.
