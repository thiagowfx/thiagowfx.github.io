[M1 Macbook air keeps disconnecting from
wifi](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/vv5day/m1_macbook_air_keeps_disconnecting_from_wifi/):

Lately I've been having the same issue, more or less. Also in a M1 Macbook Air.

There's also [this
thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255556937?sortBy=rank) in the Apple
Community forums.

Right. Times of desperation call for desperate measures, but those don't really
help.

In that thread, there is a suggestion to run Wireless diagnostics: `Option +
Wi-Fi > "Open Wireless Diagnostics..."`. This is a good idea, but it also
appeared not to work in my case.

I got reminded of a [thread](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=270326)
I posted a few years ago in the Arch Linux forums:

...which was quite similar, albeit on Linux.

It's just so frustrating whenever this happens, and it's hard to even know where
to start troubleshooting. My setup is the same as always, there was no change to
ISPs, hardware, software, or anything else, really.

There was a light at the end of the tunnel: I found this [superuser
thread](https://superuser.com/questions/826338/macbook-air-constantly-drops-wifi-connection):

Ah yes, buddy. I feel you. We are [soulmates](https://xkcd.com/979/).

Someone suggested the following:

> `% ping -i 0.2 192.168.1.1`

And, to my abysmal surprise, that seems to have worked[^1]. Rationale:

I need to make a few more experiments before I can conclude it is a reliable
solution, but so far I am sold, as I ran out of ideas. The `0.2s` interval is
too frequent though; `0.5s` appears to be enough.

The answer author suggested to wrap the script in an Automator app. This is
quite elegant, should we ever deem it as a long-term "solution". I suppose that
a [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) spoon would also be elegant in
this context.

[^1]: It could simply be placebo, as far as I'm concerned...
