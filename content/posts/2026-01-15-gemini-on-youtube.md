It's now possible to ask questions to / chat with Gen AI about YouTube
videos, directly on YouTube.

Top #1 use case: "summarize this video".

This will save _hours_ of time (per...day? week? month?).

It's much more effective than watching the video at 2x speed and/or skimming
through it.

Think of the likes of "10 reasons to do foo" or "Top 10 videogames / books of
2025" or "20 best travel destinations this Summer" or "How to make perfect
sourdough bread in 5 easy steps".

Now there's no need to watch the video whatsoever, hunting for each individual
piece of information.

I honestly have no idea how this helps the monetization strategy of the company.
If anything, this will make me spend _even less_ time browsing random videos.
