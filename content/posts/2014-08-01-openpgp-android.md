Recently I've discovered a very good free and open source e-mail application for
Android: K-9 mail; it is available both on Google Play and F-Droid.

Additionally, and the main reason that led me to install it at first, was its
native integration with APG (Google Play and F-Droid), a PGP implementation for
Android. As a mini review, I got really surprised with these apps. They are both
easy to use and full of features. I'm really satisfied with them, and this post
is a quick recommendation.

I believe it is no surprise that I really support the practice of mail signing
with Open PGP; and you probably should do it too. By the way, if you intend to
use APG, **DO NOT** copy your secret key (from, say, your computer) by using
(for example) Google Keep, or any other on-line service. You should do it
off-line, securely. I've used Syncthing to do this.
