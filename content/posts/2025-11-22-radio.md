New script: [radio](https://github.com/thiagowfx/pancake/tree/master/radio):

> Stream internet radio stations using available media players.

Available Stations:

```shell
% radio --list
Available stations:

  defcon        DEF CON Radio - Music for hacking
  lofi          Lo-fi hip hop beats
  trance        HBR1 Trance
  salsa         Latina Salsa
  kfai          KFAI (Minneapolis community radio)
```

If no station is specified, a random station will be selected.

Automatically detects and uses available media players (mpv, vlc, ffplay,
mplayer).

Sometimes it's handy to have access to a music stream quickly, without having to
resort to Spotify or YouTube, or to add cognitive overhead to choosing what to
play.

Internet radios are cool. They remind me of my good ol' times with
[BSPlayer](https://bsplayer.com/) on Windows XP / Windows 7[^1].

Inspired by [Evan
Hahn](https://evanhahn.com/scripts-i-wrote-that-i-use-all-the-time/)'s `radio`.

[^1]: Interesting to see that BSPlayer is still around!
