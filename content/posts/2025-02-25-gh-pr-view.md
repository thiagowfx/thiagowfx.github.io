When working on a local git branch that has a github PR associated to it, at
some point you'll want to open its pull request page.

If you have the [github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed (`gh`), you can do so with `gh pr view
--web`.

If you don't pass `--web`, then it will simply output markdown.
