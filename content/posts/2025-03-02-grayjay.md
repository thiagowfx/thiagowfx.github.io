It has an YouTube plug-in. It behaves similarly to [SmartTube]({{< ref
"2025-01-30-smarttube" >}}): there's built-in adblocking and
[SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/). You can log in with your Google
account to integrate history, subscriptions, etc. It acts effectively as a
no-frills YouTube Desktop client. Additionally it supports Chromecast and AirPlay.

Works as advertised on macOS, and it's super easy to install. There's no Cask
available on Homebrew though (sadly).
