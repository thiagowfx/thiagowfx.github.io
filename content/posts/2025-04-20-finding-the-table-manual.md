**Problem statement**: I bought an used table, it's not from IKEA, now I need to
find its PDF manual to figure out how to properly assemble it. The previous
owner did not have a copy available.

First step: Figure out what the make (manufacturer) is. Easy, there's a label
attached to the table, it's Finori. The label, unfortunately, does not include
the model name.

Second step: Try to find the table model in the Finori website. No success.

I go to [idealo](https://www.idealo.de/) and search for "Finori
Ausziehtisch". I couldn't find the exact model, but I got a similar one.

Somehow I ended up in Otto and found the right model[^1]. There's no PDF manual
though.

Then I go to [SearchGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and prompt, with both search and
thinking enabled:

> Can you help me find the manual of this table? {link to the otto.de listing}

It got me some similar models, but not the exact one.

At some point I got linked to an IKEA extendable table assembly video on
YouTube. The video was enough to figure out the remaining steps.

The conclusion is: IKEA is like the
[ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) of assembling furniture.
Even when assembling models from other manufacturers, it will surely help you!
