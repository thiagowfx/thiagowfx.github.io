Inspired by [Joost van der
Schee](https://www.usecue.com/blog/warrant-canary-added/):

> Warrant canary added

> I have added a canary to the homepage. It is not just a pretty illustration,
> it is a signal that is accompanied by a timestamp in the head, called a
> warrant canary. I got the idea from [this website](https://ecirtam.net/).

> The warrant canary is the digital equivalent of the canary coal miners take
> into the mine. As long as the canary is alive everything is okay. In this case
> the timestamp is the equivalent of the last time somebody checked the canary's
> well-being. The canary implicitly inform visitors about being served with a
> government subpoena (forcing the delivery of PII and meta data to the
> government), despite legal prohibitions on revealing the existence of the
> subpoena. It basically tells you that there has NOT been a court-issued
> subpoena before the canary's timestamp. The timestamp only updates when I
> publish to this website. If I ever get a subpoena I will simply stop
> publishing posts on this website. So… with every new post you will know the
> canary is still alive and our (and your) data has not been breached. Isn't
> that great news?

> I added the canary to be more transparent, but also (and more importantly) to
> raise awareness of the growing digital surveillance worldwide.
