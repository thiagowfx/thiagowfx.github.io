I've been using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) since 2-3 years ago to keep up
with German vocabulary and grammar. I had originally started with Duolingo.

In the beginning my workflow was quite basic.
Then I created [custom language]({{< ref "2024-02-03-anki-custom-language-card" >}}) [cards]({{< ref "2024-09-22-anki-custom-language-card-ii" >}}):

> After you install Anki, you need to set up a Note Type to keep your flashcards
> formatted as you like. Anki comes with a few basic Note Types, but they aren't
> suited for learning Japanese.

([via](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/setting-up-anki)). The advantage of
creating a custom note type (language card) is that I can format it the way I
want.

On top of it I tweaked my Anki deck settings to optimize it for language learning.

I adopted the [Low-Key Anki
setup](https://web.archive.org/web/20210203165239/https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/low-key-anki/intro):

> The Low-Key Anki setup is a series of counterintuitive simplifications one can
> make to Anki's algorithm that result in a significant boost in efficiency, as
> well as a considerable reduction in the stress associated with reviewing cards

Furthermore, Soren Bjornstad has helpfully written [some
tips](https://controlaltbackspace.org/precise/) about designing flashcards
effectively, some of which I gladly adopted.

And last but not least, [Refold](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup)
provided me with a step-by-step breakdown on how to configure Anki for language
learning.
