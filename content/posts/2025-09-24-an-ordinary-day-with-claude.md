> **Claude**: The PR link returns a 404 error, which means it might be a private repository or the PR doesn't exist. Could you please provide:
>
> 1. The specific changes that were made in that PR, or
> 2. A description of what changes you'd like me to apply to this repo, or
> 3. Access to view the PR if it's in a private repository
>
> **Claude**: This will help me understand exactly what modifications you need me to make in this repository.
