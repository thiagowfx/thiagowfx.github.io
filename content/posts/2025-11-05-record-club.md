I stumbled upon Record Club last week via a blog that I follow[^1]. It is a
blend of last.fm, goodreads and (old) twitter.

So far I am really enjoying it! It is a great way to discover new indie[^2]
albums and artists.

Then you'll ask: what's wrong with Spotify or YouTube recommendations? Don't
they have a great algorithm, supposedly tailored to your great musical taste?

I'll leave the answer up to you, but the issue to me is that they trap you in a
bubble. It is difficult to discover non-mainstream records in these platforms.

Browsing Record Club feels local, personal, and intimate.

Give it a try :)

If you end up discovering interesting song tracks, artists or albums there, feel
free to share them with me.

Not sure if I will maintain an active (or public) account there though.
