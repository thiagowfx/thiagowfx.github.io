[Festering](https://joshuawold.com/lingering-emails/) by Joshua Wold (via [Chris

> For at least the last fifteen years I've kept an inbox close to zero.
> Currently I'm sitting at the supposedly magical number.
>
> I like it that way.
>
> But sometimes a few emails also start to linger. I like to think of them as
> festering.
>
> I'm not clear on what action to take, not clear on the steps required, and
> tend to stare at the emails dozens of times until I come to some resolution.

What does "festering" even mean?

> A fluid product of inflammation.
