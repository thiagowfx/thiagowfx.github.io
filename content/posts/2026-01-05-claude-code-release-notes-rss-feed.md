Stay up-to-date with the [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

Did you know [it's
possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21986561/rss-to-a-github-file) to
obtain a RSS feed straight from a github repo?

The Claude Code github repository: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases

Its feed: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/releases.atom – just append
`.atom` to the repo releases URL.

If you don't have a favorite RSS reader yet, I recommendd [Miniflux]({{< ref
"2022-01-03-miniflux-rolling-my-own-rss-reader" >}}).
