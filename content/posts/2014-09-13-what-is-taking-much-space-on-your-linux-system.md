This program is so nice that I had to create a blog post just to tell people
about it: [ncdu](<http://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu>). It is the most awesome and
easiest (really easy! I would indicate it to any new Unix user as well) program
to detect which folders/files are eating too much disk space on your system.
Available for dozens of platforms. **TL;DR _and_ tutorial: just install, then
type ncdu<ENTER> and wait for the best (worse?).** See
[screenshots](<http://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu/scr>).
