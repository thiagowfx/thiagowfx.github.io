_Add quotation marks to the title_.

**Google**:

> Try out Gemini 2.5 Pro (Preview), our most powerful model yet.

**User**:

> How many Rs in RaspBerry?

**Model**:

Thinking:

Output:

> Even with the capitalization as "RaspBerry," there are still two Rs in the word.

Despite using chain-of-thought ("thinking mode") and correctly getting the right
answer (**three**) – a significant improvement compared to previous models – the
final answer is still **two**. The "thinking" part is hidden from the user by
default.

If I do an exam in university and produce an incorrect final answer, despite
giving a correct answer in the middle (whilst babbling my reasoning), my final
grade is **zero**. Just saying.

Yes, I know how an LLM works (next token prediction, tokenizer, et cetera) but
we're in 2025 and this is a thinking model, aggressively marketed and shoveled
everywhere, even when unprompted (pun intended). To say it does not meet
expectations is an understatement.

For comparison: [OpenAI /
ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/68320d74-9310-8009-874c-adde37eeb810) gets it
right. They don't make it clear which model that is though.
