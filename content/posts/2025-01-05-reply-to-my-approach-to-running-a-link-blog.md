Such a great philosophy to foster the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) in a
positive way.

Personally I think that running a link blog is exhausting: there are just soooo
many links, and they are a never-ending spiral.

On the other hand, choosing to blog instead of, say, _tweet_, adds a certain
degree of friction in such a way that you tend to implicitly cherry-pick the
links that are more relevant and/or important to you, given the opportunity
cost.

I like that.
