[TIL](https://victor.kropp.name/blog/2026/site-update/) via Victor Kropp:

The
[`light-dark()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/color_value/light-dark)
CSS function is a modern replacement for the `prefers-color-scheme` media
feature query.

As usual lately, the almighty [Amp](https://ampcode.com/) did all the heavy
lifting to
[modernize](https://github.com/thiagowfx/thiagowfx.github.io/commit/41bae9eb21eec37867e425fb12f63abc459d6e34)
this blog.

One-shot prompting is still imperfect, even with Opus 4.5. I still find myself
needing to follow-up a couple of times to ensure the feature is properly
implemented. Agents still need to be babysat and explicitly asked to test their
changes.
