If you haven't noticed, I have a new [coding]({{< ref "/tags/coding" >}})
section on this site.

For the sake of not "polluting" the main RSS feed, coding posts do not make it
to `/index.xml`. Instead, they have their own
[coding](/tags/coding/index.xml) feed.

In the future I will move [my]({{< ref "/tags/aoc" >}}) [advent of
code](https://adventofcode.com/) posts there as well.

Problem sets:

* [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com/)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
