I originally heard of [zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/) at [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/):

> zizmor is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions. It can find and fix many
> common security issues in typical GitHub Actions CI/CD setups.

One month later, I adopted it in the most important repos of our company.

A few months later, I [added]({{< ref
"2025-06-03-alpine-linux-packaging-track-new-software-releases" >}}) it to the
Alpine Linux repositories, and am happily
[maintaining](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=zizmor) it there.

Now I use it _everywhere_, via a git [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor-pre-commit
    rev: b933184438555436e38621f46ceb0c417cbed400 # frozen: v1.13.0
    hooks:
      - id: zizmor
```

The project has recently reached a milestone: [it has turned one year
old](https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/09/14/one-year-of-zizmor). Its adoption,
community and feature set have all significantly increased during that time, in
a good way.

The goal, impact and spirit of the project are all really great. And I'm sure
this is mainly thanks to the initiative and dedication of its author, [William
Woodruff](https://blog.yossarian.net/).
