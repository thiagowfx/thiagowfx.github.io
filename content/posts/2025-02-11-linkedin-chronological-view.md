[How to Replace Linkedin’s Algorithmic Timeline](https://preslav.me/2025/01/28/howto-replace-linkedin-algorithmic-timeline/) by Preslav Rachev:

It turns out it's possible to set the preferred feed / timeline view to "Most
recent", instead of the default "Most relevant posts (Recommended)". Change the
setting
[here](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/preferred-view). The
link works at the time of the publication of this post.

A bit of fresh air, and less
[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), I would say.

I don't use LinkedIn often. Especially for news, I don't think it's a good place
to become informed...however, while we're here, if you work in Tech, feel free
to connect with me (my profile is LinkedIn[^1] the footer of this site). A cool
"trick" I learned from a speaker at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/): if you write
an avocado emoji in your intro message then I'll (very likely) instantly accept
you the next time I log in (which is not often).
