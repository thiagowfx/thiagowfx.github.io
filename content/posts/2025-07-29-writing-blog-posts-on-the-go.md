By design, and to introduce intentional friction, I am only allowed to blog with
a laptop. A new post necessarily involves a git commit of a new markdown file.

Lately I've been experimenting with writing blog posts on the go. From my phone,
I simply open the Notes app and start to write.

Text (and hypertext) is the only medium I need. The occasional markup is also
fine.

It is harder to write technical posts on the go though. This is not necessarily
a caveat: it means I can focus instead on writing non-technical posts, like this
one. This is akin to how non-fiction books are better suited for audiobooks than
fiction ones. Sometimes form (and medium) shapes content.

The draft notes are then eventually transcribed to Markdown and published.
