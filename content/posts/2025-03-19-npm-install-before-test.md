**Problem statement**: `npm test` does not automatically run `npm install`.

```
% npm test
> dns-changer@1.0.0 test
> node --no-warnings --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/.bin/jest

node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1408
  throw err;
  ^

We could address this with `npm install && npm test`[^1], but these are **two**
commands. We [_should_](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) be able
to do so with one shot.

Apparently there's [`npm
install-test`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install-test)[^2]. It does
exactly what you would expect. **This is the preferred solution**.

Alternatively (and this was going to be my final solution):

```
% cat package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "pretest": "npm install",
    "test": "[...]"
  }
}
```

...then `npm test` would invoke `npm install` in advance.

[^1]: Or, even better, `npm ci && npm test`.

[^2]: There's no `npm ci-test`. Sorry to disappoint you.
