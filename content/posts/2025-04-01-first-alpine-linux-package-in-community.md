How wholesome: someone sent a MR (Merge Request)
[!82047](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/82047) in
`alpine/aports` with the [`yamlfmt`](https://github.com/google/yamlfmt) package
I maintain, moving it from `testing/` to `community/`[^1].

This means the package will be included in the next release of Alpine (3.22) as
part of its official repositories (unlike "testing", which is only included in
"edge").

**In other words**: This is the first time a package I maintain will make it to the
official repositories of a Linux distro I like!

**Next milestone**: Follow suit with a project I maintain.


[^1]: I did not initiate this: it has just happened organically / spontaneously.
