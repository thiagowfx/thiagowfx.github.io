We're all so [different](https://jeanhsu.substack.com/p/ask-vs-guess-culture), I
think it's common courtesy to finish a formal request with "feel free to say
no", especially in work environments.

Some people are conflict averse and/or wary of denying requests for fear of
increasing conflicts and/or retaliation, even when it isn't warranted.
