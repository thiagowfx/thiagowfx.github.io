Previously: [itsycal]({{< ref "2025-01-22-itsycal-system-tray-calendar-on-macos" >}}).

The same functionality is built into Raycast:

- Open Raycast settings
- Go to the Extensions tab
- Expand Calendar > My Schedule
- Under "Menu bar options > Show Events in menu bar", select "1 hour before" (or
  maybe "As long as they are upcoming").
- Profit

It integrates out-of-the-box with the calendar accounts added to the system.

Clicking the menu bar item displays an agenda overview of other events scheduled
later today.

Neat and simple! Discovery credits to [Daniel
Miessler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDj7gNfLhog) â€“ via his [Unsupervised
Learning](https://newsletter.danielmiessler.com/) podcast, which I strongly
recommend.
