**Problem statement**: When connecting the Steam Deck to a TV via a dock + HDMI
cable, the display resolution is stuck at 640x480.

No other resolutions are available, in both gaming mode and in desktop mode.

A few

It sounds disingenuous, but I verified it works indeed:

1. TV off, steam deck off.
1. Plug in the dock + the HDMI cable. **DO NOT** connect the power (yet).
1. Turn the TV on.
1. Turn the steam deck on.
1. Verify (hope, pray, wish) the resolution, it should be 1920x1080 (or
   similar).
1. Plug the power.

Your Steam Deck is connected to the TV, therefore you will need an external
Bluetooth controller to interact with it and play games. I like the
[Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/controller/) controller. It is still possible
to find a few units in the aftermarket.

Now go play your game and have fun ðŸŽ®.
