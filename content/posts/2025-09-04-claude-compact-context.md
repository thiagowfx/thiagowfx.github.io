These days, Claude Code warns you when you're running [out of
context](https://claudelog.com/faqs/what-is-claude-code-auto-compact/):

> Context left until auto-compact: 5%

It's possible to run `/compact` manually to compact the context sooner[^1].

[^1]: Let the machine do the garbage collection though! Why would you bother to
    do so manually?
