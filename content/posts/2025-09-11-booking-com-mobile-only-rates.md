When looking for accommodation deals on [Booking.com](https://booking.com)[^1], you
may or may not notice that there are some [mobile-only
rates](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/solutions/mobile-rates):

> Over half of all bookings made on our site come through a mobile device. By
> activating mobile rates at your property, you can tap into this valuable and
> expanding traveller segment.
>
> [...]
>
> All you have to do to capitalise on mobile rate benefits is to offer an
> exclusive discount of 10% or higher for those booking via mobile. Once you've
> done this, a special badge will appear next to your property in the search
> results and on your property page. This helps increase your visibility, and
> can improve your conversion rate for mobile bookers.

It can be quite inconvenient to grab your phone (or tablet) just for the sake of
doing a couple of inquiries, especially when planning a multi-city trip.

It turns out there's no need to do so. The following trick works, astonishingly:

- use your computer web browser as usual to initiate a search
- open the browser devtools pane; all major browsers have one these days
- toggle mobile mode in it

Example in Google Chrome / Chromium on macOS: press `Cmd + Option + J` followed
by `Cmd + Shift + M`.

You should then be able to tap into [mobile-only
deals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) from your computer. Enjoy!

[^1]: Nonetheless, it's still typically better to book accommodations _directly_
    from the property listings. Cut the middle men!
