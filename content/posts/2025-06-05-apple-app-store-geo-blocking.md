Apple Accounts are tied to a specific country. You can have one and only one
country associated with an account at any given time.

This is a problem whenever certain apps are restricted to _only_ certain countries
([geo-blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-blocking)).

For example, an app from a bank or a financial broker may be made available
_only_ in the country wherein it operates, thereby completely ignoring the
existence and needs of expats.

How do you know in which countries certain apps are made available? Here's one
way:

* Brazil: https://www.apple.com/br/search/
* Canada: https://www.apple.com/ca/search/
* Germany: https://www.apple.com/de/search/
* USA: https://www.apple.com/us/search/

Wanna see examples? Try searching for these apps in different stores[^1]:

* [Commerzbank](https://www.apple.com/de/search/commerzbank?src=serp) is only available in Germany.
* [MEI](https://www.apple.com/br/search/MEI?src=serp) is only available in Brazil.
* [Venmo](https://www.apple.com/us/search/venmo?src=serp) is only available in the USA.
* [WealthSimple](https://www.apple.com/ca/search/wealthsimple?src=serp) is only available in Canada.

You can change the country associated with your App Store by following Apple's
[official documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118283).

[^1]: For the sake of basic
    [OpSec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security), I don't have an
    account in any of these services, in case you were wondering :-)
