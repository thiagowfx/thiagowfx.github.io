[Dictate messages and documents on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-dictation-mh40584/mac):

> With Dictation, you can speak to enter text anywhere you can type it.

> [...]
>
> **Turn Dictation on or off**
>
> On your Mac, choose Apple menu > System Settings, then click Keyboard in the
> sidebar. (You may need to scroll down.)

It is possible to set it to the microphone key (F5 key in Macbooks) or to a
double-press of the Globe (Fn) key.

This is a good starting point to try out dictating prompts to LLMs.
