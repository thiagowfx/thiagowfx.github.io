I've decided to maintain WordPress as my primary blogging platform. I couldn't
find anything better both free and of high quality. As you can see in my last
post (in Portuguese), I got exhausted about doing the same and old (boring)
things. That included, but were not limited to, modifying my posts so they could
get more interesting to people in general. Actually, I don't really care about
that anymore. This is **my** personal blog, not an advertising one. It will be
customized as I wish.

Today I decided to maintain this blog, but a number of things will change.

**Number one:** I will write several posts in English. I know my English isn't
really so good, but I won't let this fact get in my way. We have to fall to get
up again. I will fall, committing several errors, but that will become a
possibility to self improvement. I'll appreciate any constructive critics I
eventually receive, and simply ignore any non-constructive ones.

**Number two:** I'm creating a new category, called "challenges". It will
feature some (I hope) advanced concepts (at least to me, in this point of my
timeline, right?) that I will try to learn, in a different manner I'm used to.
As a (future) software developer/engineer, I intend to push myself harder and
harder, to learn fast some trivial concepts for advanced programmers. And, the
best part (for you): any discoveries I do in the future I intend to share here,
for free (and, hopefully, in an organized manner too). As a bonus, they will be
    in a point of view of a learner (because man pages are easy to find out
    there).

So, let's (try to) learn more, more, and more. **And more**!
