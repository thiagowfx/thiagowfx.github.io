[Privacy Tests](https://privacytests.org/):

> Most web browsers leak your identity and your browsing history, but some
> browsers are more leaky than others.
>
> The goal of PrivacyTests.org is to understand in detail: what data is each web
> browser leaking? Which web browsers offer the best privacy protections?
>
> PrivacyTests.org is an open-source initiative that subjects popular web
> browsers to a suite of automated tests. These tests are designed to audit web
> browsers' privacy properties in an unbiased manner. The results of the tests
> are made public to help users make an informed choice about which browser to
> use, and to encourage browser makers to fix leaks of private user data.

I wasn't aware of [Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser).
