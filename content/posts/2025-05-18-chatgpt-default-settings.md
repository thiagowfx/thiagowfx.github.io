[ChatGPT's Privacy Trap: Default Settings You Can't Ignore](https://onlinesafety.substack.com/p/chatgpt-critical-privacy-settings) by Tate Jarrow:

> ChatGPT is not safe to use out of the box! The default settings almost
> certainly compromise your privacy because your chats (that likely contain
> personal or sensitive information) are used to train OpenAI's models, are
> reviewed by humans, and can be used to identify you uniquely.
>
> [...]
>
> However, if you are using ChatGPT and haven't updated your privacy options,
> all the data you enter can be used to train its model (and therefore is no
> longer private). This means that if you upload anything personal or sensitive,
> like a resume, work material, vacation plans, or anything else, OpenAI can
> access and use it. Additionally, OpenAI uses human review, so your data can
> also be reviewed and accessed by people. More information on how OpenAI
> handles your content is available here.

Tate recommends:

- turn off model improvement
- use temporary chats
- submit a "Do not train on my content" at OpenAI's Privacy Center.
- consider turning off "Memory".

I had the opportunity to speak with Tate once, in a virtual meeting.

In my opinion, he is quite competent and gives sound advice.
