Hello World! I've started this blog with these two words — and I seem to use
them whenever starting anything (they appeared in my first Facebook post too,
years ago). Since launching this blog, many things have changed:

- **Operating system**: Linux Mint → Arch Linux (stable)
- **Window manager**: Cinnamon/Unity → i3 (stable)
- **Shell**: bash → zsh (stable)
- **Text editor**: various → Emacs (unstable)
- **Language learning**: Started German (unstable)
- **Career**: Became a developer [semi-unstable]
- **Programming knowledge**: Discovered functional programming (unstable)
- **Community involvement**: Active in forums (stable), mailing lists (stable),
  working on IRC (unstable)
- **Critical thinking**: Developed healthy skepticism about news
  [stable→unstable→stable→unstable]
- **Relationships**: Met amazing people and learned from them (unstable)
- **Tools**: Learned about Jekyll and blogging platforms (unstable)

If you're still reading, you've probably noticed patterns. You might wonder why I'm writing about myself — am I that narcissistic?

## Why These Patterns?

- Writing in bullet points helps me write faster in both English and Portuguese
- The distinction between "stable" and "unstable" reflects my learning journey
- I've written about nearly everything listed above, so it all connects

## Here, Now

I started this platform to share knowledge. I can't open-source everything
because learning requires effort and pain — that's how your brain creates strong
neural connections.

I've documented my learning journey here, and that's created real value. I
started to love writing, sharing, and learning. And talking about it. **That
makes all the difference.** The subject doesn't matter — technical,
philosophical, or random thoughts grouped together.

**I'm happy to announce I've achieved one of this blog's goals**: writing and
talking about anything I like for a few months, then feeling satisfied
(regardless of who complains about the posts).

I'm glad about this. Some posts were nonsense, others informative, some cool,
others overlooked. I wouldn't be happy if all posts were perfect — this blog is
valuable *because* some posts are poorly written. That's how I learn from my own
mistakes.

## What's Next?

Now for level two: sharing at a deeper level. I'm not trying to cover everything
(impossible), just the things and projects that interest me most.

I'll transform my learning experiences into shareable knowledge. Knowledge is
finite and dies with us, so the best we can do is spread it further to help
others learn too.

**What will I do?** I don't know yet. I didn't know about the topics above
beforehand either, but I've grown to love them. As Andy Hunt says in his books,
blogging is excellent for practicing a subject.

I'll finish by saying *thank you* to everyone who reads my posts. Thank you for
your attention — it's a pleasure!
