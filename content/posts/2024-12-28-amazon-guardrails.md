Whenever buying stuff from Amazon it's always handy to double-check whether it's a good idea, and whether it's a good time to do so.

- Is it a good idea? Cross-reference your items with [Fakespot](https://onlinesafety.substack.com/p/everyone-should-be-using-fakespot) by Mozilla.
- Is it a good time? Check price history at [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.ca/).
