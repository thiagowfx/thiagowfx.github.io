[Post
streaks](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/ending-a-year-long-posting-streak/)
are a good way to keep oneself motivated to continuously blog for a certain
period of time.

Many folks I follow in my RSS[^1] reader participate in [100 days to
offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) every once in a while.

I figured it's finally time for me to follow suit.

> The whole point of #100DaysToOffload is to challenge you to publish 100 posts
> on your personal blog in a year.
>
> Posts don't need to be long-form, deep, meaningful, or even that well written.
> If there are spelling and grammar mistakes, or even if there's no real point
> to the post, so what? What's important is that you're writing about the things
> you want to write about.
>
> Your posts could be how-to guides, or links to another post you have found
> interesting. They could include your own thoughts about that post, or a
> response to it. It could be a simple update about what you have done that day.
> Tell us about your dog, your cat, your fish tank, or whatever hobbies you
> have. Someone will find it interesting.
>
> **Just. Write.**

Challenge accepted.
