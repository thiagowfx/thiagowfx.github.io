⏺ Great! The zizmor pre-commit check now passes. Let's summarize the changes we made:

  1. Removed user-provided inputs for version numbers that could potentially be used for code injection
  2. Replaced them with an auto-generated timestamp-based version when the workflow is manually triggered
  3. Maintained the existing behavior for automatic triggers (using "latest" tag)

  This approach is more secure since:
  1. No user inputs are used in any command execution context
  2. The version tag is generated from a trusted source (the system timestamp)
  3. The workflow still provides versioned images when manually triggered, just with an automatically generated version instead of a user-provided one
```

Let the agentic overlords take over 😬🤖.

How does it know it can do so?

```shell
% grep -i bypass ~/.claude.json
  "bypassPermissionsModeAccepted": true
```
