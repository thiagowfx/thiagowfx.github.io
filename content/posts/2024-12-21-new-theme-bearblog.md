Inspired by [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/), via [Derek
Sivers](https://sive.rs/now2), I updated my Hugo theme to resemble its looks and
simplicity.

The base theme is [hugo-bearblog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/),
but I've overridden most of its files. I should probably fork it at some point.

Side effect: no JS is served anymore. And it still scores
[100](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-perrotta-dev/eyfna507jk?form_factor=desktop)
on lighthouse.
