Simon Willison, [backfill your
blog](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/25/backfill-your-blog/):

> Fun fact: there's no rule that says you can't create a new blog today and
> backfill (and backdate) it with your writing from other platforms or sources,
> even going back many years.
>
> I'd love to see more people do this!
