To display the [IMEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity) of your iphone, open the Phone / Dialer app and type in
`*#06#`.

The IMEI is an unique numeric identifier for _devices_:

> GSM networks use the IMEI number to identify valid devices, and can stop a
> stolen phone from accessing the network. For example, if a mobile phone is
> stolen, the owner can have their network provider use the IMEI number to
> blocklist the phone. This renders the phone useless on that network and
> sometimes other networks, even if the thief changes the phone's SIM card.

It is a good practice to have your IMEI stored somewhere secure, in case you
ever need to report to your carrier the phone (w)as stolen.

What I didn't know is that it's
[possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data#Code_table)
to change your SIM card PIN with the phone app as well:
`**04*{old PIN}*{new PIN}*{new PIN}#`.
