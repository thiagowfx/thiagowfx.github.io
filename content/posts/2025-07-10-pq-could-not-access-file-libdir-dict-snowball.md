My [miniflux](http://miniflux.app/) instance broke yesterday. All feeds had the
following error:

```
3 errors - Database error: store: unable to update entry "{redacted}": pq: could not access file "$libdir/dict_snowball": No such file or directory.
```

The error is from PostgreSQL (`pq`).

I recall I did a full system upgrade yesterday (`doas apk upgrade`).

Upon checking the logs in `/var/log/apk.log`...

```

```

For whatever reason (!?), the `postgresql17*` packages were removed.

The fix is straightforward:

```shell
% doas apk add postgresql17
% doas service miniflux restart
```

Why did it break in the first place?!

There's nothing suspicious on `postgresql17` in the
[aports](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/commits/master/main/postgresql17)
repo ðŸ¤·

What is `dict_snowball`?

> `dict_snowball` is a PostgreSQL text search dictionary module that uses the
> Snowball stemming algorithms for full-text search.
