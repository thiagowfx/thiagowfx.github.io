[via Mike Rockwell](https://initialcharge.net/2024/06/folderify/):

> You install it using Homebrew, point Folderify at an image file using a simple

Project github: https://github.com/lgarron/folderify

Usage:

```shell
% brew install folderify
% folderify ~/Downloads/company_logo.webp ~/Company
```

I got our company logo lazily with Google Images + filtering for transparent
images. `.webp` worked just fine, `.png` would have worked as well.

The end result is really nice. It's a small modification that [sparks
joy](https://www.netflix.com/title/81231940).
