Positive impressions:

- works great on iOS (didn't test on Android yet)
- a great companion for **cycling** within the city
- more fun and more lightweight than Google Maps
- low impact on device battery life
- extremely privacy friendly (no ads, no tracking, no push notifications, etc)
- extremely mobile data friendly (works fully offline)
- open-source, and without any IAP
- works out-of-the-box, no sign up necessary

Negative impressions:

- do not use it for public transit, it is terrible as it does not have
  real-time data integration
