It occurred to me the **Large Prints** section of our local public library is a decent way to sample popular books.

[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-print):

> Large-print (also large-type or large-font) refers to the formatting of a book or other text document in which the typeface (or font) are considerably larger than usual to accommodate people who have low vision. Frequently the medium is also increased in size to accommodate the larger text. Special-needs libraries and many public libraries will stock large-print versions of books, along with versions written in Braille.

Instead of browsing the entire library catalogue to try to find an interesting book to read[^1], it's often more effective to browse the Large Print ones.
