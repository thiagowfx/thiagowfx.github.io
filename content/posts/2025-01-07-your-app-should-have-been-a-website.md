P. Martin Ortiz ([via Eric Schwarz](https://schwarztech.net/snippets/your-app-should-have-been-a-website)):

> Remember when every company rushed to make an app? Airlines, restaurants, even
> your local coffee shop. Back then, it made some sense. Browsers weren't as
> powerful, and apps had unique features like notifications and offline access.
> But fast-forward to today, and browsers can do all that. Yet businesses still
> push native apps as if it's 2010, and we're left downloading apps for things
> that should just work on the web.

I am waiting for the modernâ„¢ version: "your website should have been a LLM
prompt".
