Following the footsteps of [Daniel
Miessler](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielmiessler_ive-not-used-google-to-search-since-searchgpt-activity-7258159059944538113-dxZG),
I have changed my default search engine in Chrome from Google to ChatGPT
Search[^1],
by installing their official [chrome
extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-search/ejcfepkfckglbgocfkanmcdngdijcgld).

This is effectively possible because, after
[launching](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/)
it for a few months, this month they made it free for everyone.

So far the results are impressive and almost always what I am looking for.

When they are not, I can easily fall back to Google by starting my search query
in Chrome with 'g', or to DuckDuckGo with 'd'.

[^1]: They should _really_ market it as _SearchGPT_.
