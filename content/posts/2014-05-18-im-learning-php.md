Hi people, I started to learn PHP, so I've set up a public git repository at
Bitbucket to store and share some of my code (everything under the MIT license).

I'm not doing any 'challenges' anymore so this will be updated at my own pace,
but I'm setting this up in such a way it will _probably_ not be deleted.

That is: I intend to store it as a reference for (maybe?) future learners. Just
to make sure you understood:**this is not a tutorial,** but might be useful.

In the case you want try to learn it and setup your own environment too: I'm
using Gentoo with XAMPP. **KISS and clean**.

In the future, I'll probably change my default environment to Arch + ABS (=the
Arch Build System), but I'm okay for now.
