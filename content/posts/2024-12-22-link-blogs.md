As I've been slowly shaping up the workflow of my own blog, this is the kind of
post I appreciate to read and learn insights from.

I definitely agree that **"TIL Blogs"** ("today I learned") are very low stakes
and high value, thus I've been trying to get into the habit of doing so to
follow suit.

**Describing about your own projects** is also a great way to keep them flowing and
keep yourself motivated.

That said, I am not a fan of **"link blogs"**, merely because the web has an
almost infinite number of links: it's a very deep rabbit hole to fall into.
Archiving links in my second brain app is almost as good.
