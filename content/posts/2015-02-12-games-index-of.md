I am a huge fan of games in general, although nowadays I'm more of a casual
player. Today I realized I never wrote a blog post about them.

## Social networks for gaming

Social networks of games never really existed or worked at all. Steam is the
closest to one today, but in practice you become stuck in their platform. What
would one expect from a social network of games?

1. See what your friends have been playing → serendipity + you can play together
2. Track the games you have played → gamification + organization

In this sense, Kongregate satisfies those properties, although it has the same
problems as Steam: its network comprises only games on their platform. To be
successful, a potential new social network should separate metadata from
games—track only information about games, not host the games themselves.
Unfortunately, I don't know one today, so I decided to create my own list of
games. I will track comments about my gaming styles, preferences, and games I've
played from now on.
