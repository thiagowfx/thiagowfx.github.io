There is a fact that is not usually much publicized about accounts in the web:
in general, if a given web service doesn't have a **delete** button, you can
instead request manually the deletion of your account, by e-mailing the
administration of the service. Usually the e-mail you want to contact is
localized somewhere on the 'contact' or 'about' page of the service, or even in
the homepage. If not, you can try to make educated guesses:

* admin@example.org
* contact@example.org
* support@example.org

Through the last months I occasionally deleted some of my accounts and I confirm
that this method usually works all the time. (**Bias:** )Well, at least if you
subscribed to services with good admin/policies in the first place... But
really, even when my account couldn't be deleted for...er...bad design in the
database, I got nice replies from real people (not robots :-P (yet)). There are
a few exceptions for this. One is when it isn't an advantage for the service to
have you gone. Example? Facebook. You can only deactivate your account; there is
no option to permanently delete it. And don't you even try to contact
Zuckerberg...other exceptions I have yet to experience. If you have any good (or
bad) experience about **account deletion requests,** don't hesitate to share it
in the comments. Have a nice day.
