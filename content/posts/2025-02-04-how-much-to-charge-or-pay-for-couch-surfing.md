First of all, you should _arguably_ not charge:

- good or close friends
- apartment swapping[^1]
- reciprocal couch surfing

If you determine that charging is appropriate, even if only symbolically,
[Splitwise](https://splitwise.com) has a ["Guest
Calculator"](https://secure.splitwise.com/calculators/guest):

- What is the rent for your apartment?
- How often do you pay rent? (weekly / fortnightly / monthly)
- How many people normally live in the apartment?
- How many nights is the guest staying?

Example simulation:

- $1000 / month
- 1 person
- 4 nights

...yields ~$53. Splitwise

a gift instead of a cash payment.
