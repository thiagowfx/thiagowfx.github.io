Today I learned: https://0ver.org/

> With software releases at an all-time high, the consensus has never been
> clearer: Major versions are over. So what does the past, present, and future
> of software versioning look like? Welcome to ZeroVer 0.0.1.

> Unlike other versioning schemes like Semantic Versioning and Calendar
> Versioning, ZeroVer (AKA 0ver) is simple: Your software's major version should
> never exceed the first and most important number in computing: zero.

> A down-to-earth demo:

> YES: 0.0.1, 0.1.0dev, 0.4.0, 0.4.1, 0.9.8n, 0.999999999, 0.0

> NO: 1.0, 1.0.0-rc1, 18.0, 2018.04.01

In general I use [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

[CalVer](https://calver.org/) is also handy in certain scenarios.
