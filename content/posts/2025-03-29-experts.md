Suddenly it feels like everyone is an expert on "AI".

For example, MCP (Model Context Protocol) got released quite recently and some
folks are already writing extensive articles about it, as if they had been
working with the technology for ages[^1].

It resembles people giving advice about COVID-19 a few years ago, or about
finance and/or taxes and/or parenting in general.

I am guessing that surfing the {insert current hype wave} is the way to go,
assuming you follow internet adviceâ„¢.

Nonetheless the challenge is, as everything else in life, to develop the ability
to tell apart [the](https://simonwillison.net/)
[good](https://danielmiessler.com/) from the bad ones[^2].

[^1]: Which makes me wonder how much of these articles were written with or
    assisted by Gen AI itself.

[^2]: I won't link to bad ones as a matter of principle, and also because they
    don't deserve more attention.
