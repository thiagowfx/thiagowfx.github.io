Snark aside, that's a good read.

Ever since ["Cloud Native"](https://www.cncf.io/) became mainstream, developer
userspace tools became more valuable than whatever OS flavour you choose to run.

work hard, and have fun.

And yes, 2025 is finally the [year of the linux desktop](https://yotld.com/)[^1].
