How relevant these words of wisdom still are!

I haven't been closely following the news ever since the great pandemicâ„¢. This
includes social media, apple / google news, and portals from news organizations.
I go out of my way to prevent the constant barrage of unnecessary anxiety and
fearmongering from affecting me.

There are other ways to stay up-to-date with relevant topics.

My primary sources are:

- the excellent [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/), my beloved RSS reader. As of
  the time of this publication, I am following 350+ feeds. Quantity is not an
  important metric here, especially as most of these feeds do not publish daily
- local news. These are the most impactful ones, as they affect the environment
  where I live and could thus influence or change my short or medium-term
  planning
- friends & family, mostly via chat apps through individual conversations or
  group chats

There is rarely a need for immediate action. Furthermore the news that are
_truly_ important or relevant end up spreading like fire, to the point where
it's impossible not to have heard of them.

**Corollary**: Life is short, make a better use of your time. There are plenty
of ways to do so[^1]!
