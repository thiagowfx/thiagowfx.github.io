## Transportation

### Public Transportation

There are 4 means of public transit:

- S-Bahn: trains (mnemonic: surface)
- U-Bahns: subways, metros (mnemonic: underground)
- Tram: light rail
- Bus

When I moved to Munich I thought S-Bahn was the Subway, but the "S" actually stands for "Surface."

It's possible to get either physical tickets or digital tickets ("HandyTickets"). Digital tickets are more convenient, however you must ensure your phone stays charged, otherwise you could be fined 60 EUR when caught without a valid ticket. I'm told it's possible to dispute the fine by paying 7 EUR and spending time & energy in some Amt (office). In practice, checks rarely happen in buses and trams, however they happen more frequently in U-Bahns and S-Bahns, especially in the S-Bahns to or from the airport (MUC).

When choosing an apartment, it's often a good idea to find a well-connected place within a decent walking range (less than 10min) to S-Bahns or U-Bahns. They tend to come every 5 or 10min depending on which line, time of day, and day. Buses and trams, on the other hand, tend to come every 10min during the day and every 20min during off-peak hours (e.g. late evening).

There are late night buses and trams. Their numbers usually start with an N (e.g. N20). They are usually available from 1am (01:00).

The most no-brainer way to think about transportation tickets is to get a monthly (or weekly) pass, the so called "IsarCard". Then you can take all of the above means of transportation.

It's important to watch out for zones. There are 7 zones in Munich: M, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. If you're in the city center, zone M is usually enough and covers most of your typical destinations. The MUC airport is in zone 5. This means that in order to get to the airport you'll need a valid M-5 ticket. If you already have a zone M ticket (e.g. from weekly or monthly pass), then you can buy an extension ticket ("Anschlussticket") that covers zones 1-5. Combined with your zone M ticket, it effectively covers the M-5 zone range. This is cheaper than buying a single M-5 ticket.

If you're traveling with a group to the airport, consider getting a group ticket. It's usually cheaper than getting individual tickets for every single individual. You can have up to 5 adults in your group.

There are at least 4 phone apps to buy tickets: MVG Fahrinfo, MVGO, MVV and DB Navigator. I recommend the first one. It's available in English as well as in German.
