[Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/ip-addresses/) has one of
the coolest DNS IP addresses on the planet: `1.1.1.1` (primary) and `1.0.0.1`
(secondary).

Furthermore they have another class of DNS servers ["for
families"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/),
intended to block malware and/or adult content.

They are also quite memorable:

- Malware: `1.1.1.2`, `1.0.0.2`
- Adult content: `1.1.1.3`, `1.0.0.3`
