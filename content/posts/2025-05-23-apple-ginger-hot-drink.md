## Apfel-Ingwer Heißgetränk (Apple-Ginger Hot Drink)

A fantastic choice when one is feeling sick e.g. with flu-like symptoms[^1].

### Ingredients

- 1 cup natural apple juice (Apfelsaft, preferably naturtrüb) 🍎
- 1 piece fresh ginger, thinly peeled and sliced 🫚
- Juice of 1/2 lemon 🍋
- 1 teaspoon honey 🍯
- Pinch of cinnamon or clove (optional)

### Instructions

1. Heat the apple juice and ginger in a pot for 5–10 minutes.
2. Add lemon juice and honey just before serving.
3. **Optional**: add a dash of cinnamon or clove for holiday vibes.

Tastes like: A warm apple punch with healing ginger notes — somewhat like a
healthier Glühwein.

[^1]: Whenever you're tired of having vitamin C, ginger shots and cough syrup
    (Hustensaft).
