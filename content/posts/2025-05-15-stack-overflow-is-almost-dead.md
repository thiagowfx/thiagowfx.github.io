A bit of politeness[^2] goes a long way, eh?

Where do you ask novel questions these days?

Stack Exchange is still my to-go site for that, but it's starting to feel like a
ghost town. Oftentimes I end up self-answering my own question, because no one
else does. Nonetheless, I'd rather post on my blog if I know the answer in
  advance. The reason to post on SE is when _I don't know_.

It feels to me the best place to ask specific questions these days is wherever
the project is developed. GitHub or GitLab issues, Discourse (BBS / forums),
Discord[^3], Slack...and so on. There's a lot of fragmentation. Perhaps that's
not to bad after all, but it incurs additional effort.

And where to ask general questions? Reddit[^3], the Fediverseâ„¢, social media,
project-agnostic chat platforms / communities...

Perhaps one day we'll just be able to tell our LLM agents to go out there in the
dark corners of the Web[^4] to ask a question for us.


[^1]: I am (nit)picky. Gergely did **not** capitalize "overflow". _This is plainly wrong_!!1! ðŸ¤·

[^2]: ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

[^3]: Ewwww.

[^4]: Will the Web even be alive by then?
