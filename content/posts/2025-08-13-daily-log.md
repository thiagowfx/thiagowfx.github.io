It's easy to get distracted when using computers connected to the internet.
Like, errhmm, when you are doing your job.

I tend to minimize some distractions by reducing notifications and by
turning on do not disturb on my phone. Having / using less social media also
helps.

What about Internet distractions in my work laptop though?

Lately I've been trying out a new habit that appears to keep me more focused
throughout the day.

First, I open my note-taking / second brain app ([LogSeq](https://logseq.com/)).

Next, create a new journal page for it (`Aug 13th, 2025` or `2025-08-13`).

One reason I like LogSeq is that it does it automatically for me, every day.

Then I create a heading called "Daily log"[^1].

I think about what to work on next, typically based on ticket prioritization or
sprint planning or dealing with whatever fire is going on at the moment or a
"20%" project to improve overall code health.

Then I type in `/time<ENTER>`. LogSeq helpfully inserts the current time e.g.
`13:14`. Afterwards, I write a single sentence about what I'm going to do. For
example:

- 14:18 Sync docker images for bitnamilegacy
- 14:45 Experiment with pruning in Argo

This is not intended to be a meticulous report, as it doesn't impact me in any
way (e.g. for performance reviews).

I merely observed that jotting one slice of idea down makes my intent concrete,
clear(er), and helps me stay focused on it, instead of thinking on the next
procrastination browser tab to open to get distracted with.

There's also a psychological effect wherein observing my accomplishments at the
end of the day simply feels good.

And last but not least, it becomes easier for me to remember what I worked on
during the day, making my stand-up meetings more comprehensive.

[^1]: Or "Daily". The name is not important.
