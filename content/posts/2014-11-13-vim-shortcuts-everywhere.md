Recently I've been switching my mind and workflow from emacs keybindings to vim
ones, so there is nothing better than being able to use those shortcut keys on
as many applications as possible. Currently ones I'm trying include:

 1. vim itself
 2. emacs with evil-mode
 3. firefox with vimperator (there's an Arch package for it)
 4. chromium with vimium
 5. luakit (KISS web browsing)
 6. tmux
 7. i3 window manager

Edit: forgot this one:

1. zathura (PDF/PS/DJVU viewer)

And I'm pretty sure there is plenty more to find out.
