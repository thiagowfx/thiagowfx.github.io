[Previously]({{< ref "2025-05-17-blog-directories" >}}).

**Problem statement**: I ran out of blog posts to read! Now what?

**Option #1**: Take a deep breath, leave the computer, put your phone away.

You're not here for that though, are you?

**Option #2**: [Stumble upon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon)™
delightful blog networks. I like:

1. [Bear Blog Discover](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) (see also: [most recent](https://bearblog.dev/discover/?newest=true))
1. [PowRSS](https://powrss.com/) (see also: [shuffle](https://powrss.com/shuffle), [random](https://powrss.com/random))
1. [Kagi Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb) → [RSS
   Social](https://rss.social/)
1. [Diff Blog](https://diff.blog/)

It's better than social media and short videos, I think.
