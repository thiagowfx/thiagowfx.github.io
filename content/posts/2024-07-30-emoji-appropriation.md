Sometimes, when you chat with people, you notice that they tend to use a certain
(sub)set of emojis frequently. The emoji choice is part of their personality.

After a while, you then start to associate the emoji with the person[^1], even
when it is used in other contexts, by other people.

It is such a powerful association meaning.

Which emoji are you?

Also, some people (millennials?) tend to (over)use emoticons, perhaps even more
so than GIFs by Gen-Z. ;)

[^1]: Caveat: Your exes better not have their own emoji identity, or else you
    _will_ remember them whenever you see the emoji.
