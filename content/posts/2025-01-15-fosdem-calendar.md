[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/):

> FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and
> collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source
> software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels. You don't
> need to register. Just turn up and join in!

[FOSDEM 2025 schedule](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/):

> FOSDEM is a rather busy conference. This edition features 1056 speakers, 1004
> events, and 74 tracks. We do our best to provide you with as much information
> and navigation options about the schedule as we can.

How can you keep track of which talks to attend? There's a myriad of them!

> Ways to have the schedule with you at all times, without wasting trees.

This year I signed up for [Sojourner](https://fosdem.sojourner.rocks/2025)[^1].
It's a no-frills [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app). I
would recommend it!

Back in FOSDEM 2023 I used the
[FOSDEM.app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fosdem-app/id1513719757) for iOS. It
was OK.

There's also an [iCal](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/ical) feed, but it's too
noisy as it lists every single talk of the conference, and it doesn't allow you
to filter out the ones you're not interested in.

_PS. If you're also going to FOSDEM this year, please do reach out! :D_

[^1]: There's a great [videogame](https://www.thesojourngame.com/) with the same
    name.
