Besides [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) by the NYT and
[Jumblie]({{< ref "2024-02-01-jumblie" >}}) by Cassidy Williams, now we have
[Pears](https://slate.com/games/pears) by Slate.

It's a word game in the same spirit of its predecessors.

A different game every day.

I find it a bit harder (challenging!) than it seems at first glance.
