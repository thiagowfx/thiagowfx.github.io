**Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example** ("sscce"):

If you are having a problem with some code and seeking help, preparing a Short,
Self Contained, Correct Example (SSCCE) is very useful. But what is an SSCCE?

It is all in the name, really. Take a look at each part. The version prepared
for others to see should be:

- Short (Small): Minimise bandwidth for the example, do not bore the audience.
- Self Contained: Ensure everything is included, ready to go.
- Correct: Copy, paste, (compile,) see is the aim.
- Example: Displays the problem we are trying to solve.
