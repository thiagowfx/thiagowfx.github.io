I've just fallen in love with the amazing orgmode. What the _hell_ is this? I
talked about it before: it is a super add-on (**mode**) for Emacs, where you can
organize, note and plan just every thing and aspect of your life. I'm not
describing it here in more details; if you want to peek through its features,
just access this page. I'd just like to share some of my (current) usages of it:

 1. Once I published in this blog that "Favoritos são o terror" (something like
    'bookmarks/links are the worst'). Well, not anymore! Now I feel so much
    comfortable organizing my bookmarks with orgmode + version control (git).
    Before: I used to throw every bookmark in a different folder in my browser
    (that was both with Firefox and Chromium). My conclusion: this is so bad.
    Please just don't do that. It is better to save nothing than to save
    everything. Now, storing my bookmarks in plain text **and** with version
    control, I have complete control of them. There is also a bonus: **focus**.
    By design (of orgmode), these bookmarks will not get into my way when they
    are not needed.
 2. I use orgmode to publish posts in this blog (this one is an example!),
    thanks to **org2blog**. Believe me, this is much faster than logging into
    wordpress and trying to format everything there. Of course, sometimes I
    still use the wordpress web interface. But org2blog is (by far) more
    comfortable, and faster.
 3. I'm beginning to convert every TODO list that I have scattered through
    everywhere into a few .org files. By adding these files to the org agenda I
    can easily keep track of every goal and things I have to do. This is
    boosting (for **now** , just a little, since I'm migrating my workflow) my
    productivity and fighting with my stress.
 4. Finally, my main motivation: I'm organizing and tracking my progress with a
    list of things to study using orgmode.

Once I asked myself if learning Emacs would be a wise choice. Today I can look
back and say: _yes, it was_. Just for orgmode. Do not underestimate the powers
of the unicorn.
