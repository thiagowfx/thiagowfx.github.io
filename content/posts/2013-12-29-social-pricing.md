Excellent article regarding online prices. If you are a heavy Steam or Amazon
user, for example, it may be interesting.

## About "status"

First things first:

* I won't (don't) use **Twitter** anymore (it became popular, so it became a
 dirty / floodish (this word probably doesn't even exist) / useless place;
* I can't use **identi.ca** because it is gone;
* I won't use **diaspora** because I didn't find it *that* much attractive;
* and I don't like **Tumblr** for some reason I'll still have to figure out why.

And, you know, this "microblogging" thing is so common nowadays. What are my
remaining options? **Wordpress**! Sure! From now on I intend to use this blog as
a microblogging service too. Actually I got this idea from Allan McRae (an Arch
Linux Developer). Unfortunately my current Wordpress theme (which I love)
doesn't have a *status* template. So I'll use a *status* category, plus add the
[status] indicator to all of my post titles under this category. What you should
expect from **status:**

* Usually they I'll have one (and only one) **link**, sometimes accompanied
 with a little **comment** from me;
* They'll be **short** (twitter like, I guess)!

This will be the largest status, because it is the first one (explicitly).
Besides, if you reached here through Facebook or Google+, you should know that
from now on I'll try to post (relatively to me) more important / useful / "non
flood" links here. This means that if I post a link **directly** on Facebook or
Google+, *probably* (but not always) it won't be *that* much important (for
example, it may be a funny YouTube video, or a comic from xkcd). By the way, the
rule of language usually will be: links in English will have comments in English
and links in Portuguese will have comments in Portuguese. KISS.
