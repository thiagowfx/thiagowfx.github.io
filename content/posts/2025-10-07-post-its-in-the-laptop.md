Poor man's TODO list / task manager: sticking post-it notes in[^1] the laptop,
next to the touchpad / trackpad. It is practically impossible to ignore them!

[^1]: _On_ the surface of the keyboard, not outside its lid case. "In" feels
    appropriate because it refers to the _inside_ of the laptop. And now the
    footnote is longer than the post!
