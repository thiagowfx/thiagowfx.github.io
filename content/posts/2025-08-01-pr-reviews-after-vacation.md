You send in a couple of pull requests for your teammates to review.

Then you go on a break. Vacation. Time-off. Holiday. PTO. Pleasure has many
names.

They had a lot of time to review your PRs. Surely there will be various comments
by the time you're back, right?

Several action items to be addressed. You're already excited to ~~move
mountains~~ move more protos, eh?!

Certainly you will be 100% (_hundred per-cent!_) unblocked the first day you're
back to work, correct!?

There will be no need to "friendly" ping anyone. Aaaah, so peaceful. So
productive. Corporate paradise.

Do we live in the same world?

### Master Foo and the Absent Pull Requests[^1]

A novice once sent two pullâ€‘requests before departing for a long holiday.

Upon their return they asked the Master, "Have my PRs been reviewed?"

The Master sat quietly. At last he said, "I sent no pings."

The novice frowned and said, "But my colleagues had all the time. There must be comments, requests, feedback."

The Master looked at the floor and replied, "What is unreviewed code?"

The novice said nothing.

Then the Master added: "What is urgent code that never landed?"

An instant later, the novice was enlightened.
