One year after Snowden's NSA whistleblowing, the Reset the Net campaign launched
with a simple principle: **encrypt everything**.

This isn't only about privacy — it's an opportunity to learn new tools and
techniques. Here are tools I recommend:

## Secure Messaging

Use encrypted communication instead of Facebook Chat, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts,
or Skype. I'm testing:

- Red Phone
- ChatSecure
- TextSecure (tried once)
- Telegram (has secure chat feature)

## Email / Mailing Lists

Use OpenPGP to sign emails and encrypt messages to specific people. I sign
emails on mailing lists where at least some people understand signed emails.

## Password Managers

Don't let your browser manage passwords. Use external tools:

- **LastPass** or **KeePassX** (recommended)
- For OS X: Master Password and others

## Two-Factor Authentication

If you have a smartphone: **just use 2FA**. No excuses. At minimum, enable it on
Google, Facebook, and Dropbox.

## Facebook Message Encryption

**CryptoCat** is an amazing browser extension for encrypting Facebook messages.
Install it and send me an encrypted message!

## Overall

Visit the [Reset the Net project](http://prism-break.org/) to explore tools that
matter to you. I've selected some here and added others. Comment with tools you
prefer or use!
