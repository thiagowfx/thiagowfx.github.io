As much as I love my [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) setup, I've also come to
appreciate some indie blog aggregators. They are especially handy when I feel
like breaking out of my own bubble and/or getting the occasional serendipity dose
to discover new blogs to follow.


Here's a non-exhaustive list in alphabetical order:

(i) Aggregation of blogs, acts as poor man's RSS feed readers that someone else manages:

- [Blog Surf](https://blogsurf.io/), by [DKB](https://dkb.io/): See [about](https://blogsurf.io/about/).
- [Diff Blog](https://diff.blog/): See [FAQ](https://diff.blog/FAQ/).

(ii) Article submission websites, where their users can submit articles which are then upvoted (or not) by other users (_wisdom of the crowds_):

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). You probably know this one already. The [/best](https://news.ycombinator.com/best) page should yield a higher SNR[^1]. Alternatively, to consume the best of hacker news directly in your RSS feed, you can use something like [HNRSS](https://hnrss.org/newest?points=250) to filter out all submissions below a certain threshold.
- [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/). See [about](https://lobste.rs/about). Lobsters is basically a more niche version of Hacker News. One distinctive feature is that new users can only join if they are invited by another user[^2].

And for completeness I'll also mention [Reddit](https://reddit.com/) but everyone already knows it at this point.
