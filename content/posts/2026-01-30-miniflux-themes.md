I've been using [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) [for ages]({{< ref
"2022-01-03-miniflux-rolling-my-own-rss-reader" >}}).

And yet I never bothered to customize it much. Its vanilla settings are great
out-of-the-box – as it should be!

That said, it's quite straightforward to add custom CSS to miniflux.

I found two themes that are visually appealing:

- [solarized](https://gist.github.com/echoriiku/1fe309493a58e86c082d3f4c39c3e122)
- [catppuccin latte](https://github.com/catppuccin/miniflux/blob/main/themes/catppuccin-latte.css#L8)

Copy the CSS snippet, go to Settings > Custom CSS in the miniflux UI, paste it
there and save the config. Enjoy.
