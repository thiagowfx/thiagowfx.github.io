One little anecdote.

Last week I bookmarked [this query](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vertical+pod+autoscaler+argocd+sync+loop&ia=web) on DuckDuckGo[^1]:

> vertical pod autoscaler argocd sync loop

Eventually I resolved the issue and wrote a [blog post]({{< ref "2025-02-13-argocd-vertical-pod-autoscaler-sync-loop" >}}) about it.

Today I clicked the bookmark accidentally (I forgot to delete it last week).

For my delighted surprise, the blog post I had written was the top #1 result on
DuckDuckGo. I was curious to check it on Google, and it's the top result
[there](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=vertical%20pod%20autoscaler%20argocd%20sync%20loop)
as well.

That's so..._cool_! Especially because it was totally unexpected.

Now...back to work.
