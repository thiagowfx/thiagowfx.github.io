The author has an unnecessarily harsh tone, but I concur with the general
sentiment behind it.

If one is willing to put in the effort to research and [ask deliberate
questions][smart-questions], one will _almost_ always reap their benefits in
the long term. The _almost_ qualifier is needed because nothing is perfect and
your mileage will always vary, and the internet has all kinds of people, for
better or for worse.

Within the Linux world in particular, forums and mailing lists are
indispensable resources. Pretty much every Linux distribution has its own async
support channels. For forums, BBS-like platforms are still common, and
[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)[^1] is becoming increasingly popular.
For mailing lists, [mailman](https://list.org/) is still very common. It is
generally annoying to create multiple accounts everywhere, but you could always
create an alias if need be, and [password
managers](https://www.passwordstore.org/) are the key to manage multiple
accounts.

One highlight within this realm is [Linux
Questions](https://www.linuxquestions.org/).

Sync support channels (=web chats) aren't that great, pick your poison: they
are either not very user-friendly (e.g. IRC) or too fragmented / noisy (e.g.
Telegram, Slack, Discord, Matrix...), given the amount of ongoing discussions
typical in large communities. I've had success with IRC in the past though[^2].

Last but not least, the [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) network
has many sites dedicated for Linux / Unix support. Some highlights in order of
helpfulness:

- [Unix & Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/)
- [Super User](https://superuser.com/)
- [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/)
- [Elementary OS](https://elementaryos.stackexchange.com/)
- [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/users/180092/thiagowfx)

[^1]: Not to be confused with [Discord](https://discord.com/)...
[^2]: For example, the folks in the [Alpine Linux IRC
  channels](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux:IRC) are generally
  friendly and helpful. [Example]({{< ref
