Recently I had to opportunity to watch [this classic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/) during a flight.

It's such a great movie[^2].

It was the second time I watched it. The first one was during my teenage years,
probably around 15-16.

Many years later, with a few bits of wisdom and experience by the means of
romances, heartbreaks, and situationships, it feels so natural (and perhaps
dangerously familiar) to empathize with both protagonists.

In the old days I could only empathize with Tom (_Joseph Gordon-Levitt_). I'd
get frustrated at Summer (_Zooey Deschanel_). Like, why, just whyyyyy do you act
like this?

Today, suddenly, Summer's perspective totally resonates with me. Even though it
is seemingly irrational (_you don't want a boyfriend, but then all of a sudden
you marry someone else right after breaking up with me? WTH?!_).

And the most interesting part, perhaps, is to reach the conclusion that there is
no ultimate right or wrong side. Moral is subjective. Each character is equally
beautiful in their own way, with their own desires and insecurities, with their
own definition of happiness, their own emotions and pragmatism, and their own
way of shielding out from unknowns.

The soundtrack is relaxing and satisfying. It hasn't aged at all. [_You make my
dreams come true_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EErSKhC0CZs) 🎶. Each and
every day <3.

Vivid experience makes you easily recognize [attachment
styles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9547888-attached) in each character.
The avoidant is afraid of closeness and love. The anxious is afraid of
rejection.

Is it fair to always label the avoidant as the villain, or is that just another
perfectly acceptable way of l{o,i}ving? Is it fair to always label the anxious
as a (the) victim, to judge that they should know better?

Aren't we always picturing ourselves in the perfect scenario, constantly
juggling _expectations versus reality_? The happy path user journey is often
just an illusion, a simplified model that doesn't match reality in any universe
known to mankind, except in imaginary mathematical land. The real word is
beautifully complex[^1].

I love the direction of the movie. The narration. The flashbacks. _This
is not a love story_[^3].

_Is is true? Do you like me?_

Joseph-Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are peak charisma.

It's a masterpiece.

[^1]: Which is sometimes annoying to us Engineers. But can't complain, that
    justifies the raison d'être™ of the profession.
[^2]: 7.6 / 10 ⭐️ on IMDB is underrated.
