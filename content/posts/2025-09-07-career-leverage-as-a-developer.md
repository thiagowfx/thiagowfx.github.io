Dan Moore, [Career Leverage as a Developer](https://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3712):

Big Tech is full of "differentiated problems". See [golden handcuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs)[^1].

I am blessed enough to have been conditioned towards this path in my entire
life, though it's fairly biased of myself to say so :-)

[^1]: "Often employees feel the urge to remain within the company they've been
    working with, even though it may not seem like the smartest choice,
    objectively, because of tradition, relationships or a simple feeling of
    belonging".
