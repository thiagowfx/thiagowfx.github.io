Back in my Windows days, in my first desktop computer, I would happily launch
[BSPlayer](https://bsplayer.com/) and listen to radio stations.

Somewhat later, in my desktop Linux, I would happily launch
[Clementine](https://www.clementine-player.org/) and listen to radio stations.

Now, in macOS, I mostly browse Spotify. But there isn't a lot of serendipity
there: I just find myself browsing the same songs over and over again. Spotify
used to be social, if you connected it to Facebook, you could find what your
friends were listening to. Many of my favorite artists were discovered this way.
These days, however, my generation no longer uses Facebook, and Spotify is
barely social anymore.

[DEFCON Radio](https://somafm.com/defcon/) can bring some of that nostalgia
back. Well, the entire [soma fm](http://somafm.com/) network is quite decent,
for that matter:

> Over 30 unique channels of listener-supported, commercial-free,
> underground/alternative radio broadcasting to the world. All music hand-picked
> by SomaFM's award-winning DJs and music directors.
