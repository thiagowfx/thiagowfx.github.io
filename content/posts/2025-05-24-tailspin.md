[tailspin](https://github.com/bensadeh/tailspin):

> `tailspin` works by reading through a log file line by line, running a series
> of regexes against each line. The regexes recognize patterns you expect to
> find in a logfile, like dates, numbers, severity keywords and more.
>
> `tailspin` does not make any assumptions on the format or position of the
> items it wants to highlight. For this reason, it requires no configuration and
> the highlighting will work consistently across different logfiles.

The binary name is `tspin(1)`, not `tailspin(1)` (confusing!). MacOS has an
existing `/usr/bin/tailspin` binary, which appears to be kernel-related.

It supports `-f` (`--follow`), just like `tail(1)`. In fact, you can think of
`tspin -f` as a drop-in replacement for `tail -f`.

It is available in [most package
managers](https://repology.org/project/tailspin/versions).

It supports custom highlight rules (groups) via a `~/.config/tailspin` file.

Usage:

```shell
# against a log file
% tspin -f /var/log/system.log

# against a command
% kubectl logs mypod -n myns -f | tspin

# built-in highlighters showcase
% echo "2025-01-01 hello null true false 42 https://example.com?param1=foo&param2=bar ERROR WARNING WARN INFO 127.0.0.1 /etc/passwd foo='bar'"  | tspin
```

It's possible to add one-off highlighters from the command line (note: case
sensitive).

```shell
% tspin --highlight=red:err,error,fail --highlight=green:success,ok
```
