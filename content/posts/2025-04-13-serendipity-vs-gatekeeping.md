Serendipity, via
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=serendipity+definition&ia=web&iax=definition) dictionary:

> **1.** The faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident.
>
> **6.** Good luck in making unexpected and fortunate discoveries.

Gatekeeping, via
[Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gatekeeping)
dictionary:

> The activity of trying to control who gets particular resources, power, or
> opportunities, and who does not.

Serendipity spreader, via [yours truly](https://perrotta.dev/)[^1]:

> 1. One who facilitates (spreads) serendipity amongst its acquaintances and
>    peers.

Gatekeeper, via [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=gatekeeper+define&ia=web)
dictionary:

> 3. One who controls access to something, such as information or services.

Definitions set, here comes the fun part:

- **Lemma #1**: Gatekeepers are, by definition, the opposite of serendipity
spreaders. You can visualize them in a 2D scale, from left to right, somewhat
akin to how people attempt to project politics onto a line.

- **Lemma #2**: Open Source Software (OSS) is a giftâ„¢ driven primarily by
serendipity spreaders.

- **Lemma #3**: In terms of friendships, the optimal point of joy and
  satisfaction lies within seeking and maintaining serendipity spreaders whilst
  avoiding gatekeepers at all costs. It yields a rewarding continuous feedback
  loop.

- **Lemma #4**: Gatekeepers drag serendipity spreaders down. They are like
  leeches (parasites).

- **Lemma #5**: Serendipity spreaders thrive together.

- **Lemma #6**: In a set full of serendipity spreaders, one gatekeeper is enough
  to [disrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) the entire
  group, thereby leading to the conversion of new gatekeepers.

- **Lemma #7**: In a set full of gatekeepers, one serendipity spreader is enough
  to spread serendipity; however, the bar to convert to more serendipity
  spreaders is extremely high, and it's very taxing.

Several conclusions can be drawn from these lemmas; nonetheless, this is not a
blog about philosophy or morals, therefore the exercise is left to the reader.

[^1]: I coined this term myself, inspired by hearing about
    [superspreaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superspreading_event) during
    the COVID-19 pandemic. The definition was written without AI. This is a
    badge of honour these days, isn't it? I'll take it.
