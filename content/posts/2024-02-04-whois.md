I got myself a brand new domain! As I play with it, expect documentation to
be added.

**How to query the WHOIS for the domain?**

1. From the command line: `$ whois <domain>`
1. From the registrar WHOIS, e.g. https://porkbun.com/whois, https://www.gandi.net/en/domain/p/whois
1. From the registry WHOIS, e.g. https://lookup.icann.org/, https://www.registry.google/whois-lookup/

It's a good idea to set up WHOIS privacy, so that your domain registration
details stay private. Some registrars such as Porkbun and NearlyFreeSpeech will
gladly offer an option for that, either for free or at a low cost, respectively.
