I highly value when people combine greeting + request right away when messaging
folks. Less interruption – more efficiency! You can be friendly even with an
_oneshot_ message.

At Google there is a go/nohello internal link you could put in your Teams
profile to signal this preference to your fellow coworkers.

Externally, there are various sources that can be used:

- https://nohello.net/en/ (classic, canonical)

> Imagine calling someone on the phone, going hello! then putting them on
> hold... 🤦‍♀️
>
> [...]
>
> It may seem trivial, but asking your question before getting that initial
> salutatory reply also allows for asynchronous communication. If the other
> party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your
> question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.

- https://no-hello.com/ (text only)

- https://nohello.wtf/ (sassy domain)
- https://nohello.club/ (SMS screenshots, a custom logo)

A bit of lore from [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44297431):

> I'm the original author of this content. I wrote it on the internal wiki at

> left Google. It's made the front page of HN multiple times.

> The discussions always split between the people who just want to get on with
