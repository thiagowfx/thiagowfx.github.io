The [Steam Summer Sale](https://store.steampowered.com/) is going on, as usual.

I never understood how their rating system works. Until now:

```
95 - 100 | 500+ reviews | positive | overwhelming
85 - 100 |  50+ reviews | positive | very
80 - 100 |   1+ reviews | positive
70 -  79 |   1+ reviews | positive | mostly
40 -  69 |   1+ reviews | mixed
20 -  39 |   1+ reviews | negative | mostly
 0 -  19 |   1+ reviews | negative
 0 -  19 |  50+ reviews | negative | very
 0 -  19 | 500+ reviews | negative | overwhelming
```

Basically, look for games with "overwhelmingly positive" or "very positive"
reviews.
