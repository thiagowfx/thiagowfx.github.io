Let me peek at your desk at work and/or at home and I'll be able to instantly
tell, up to a certain (high) degree of confidence, how organized and/or
productive you are digitally.

Put it another way: "a desk is worth a thousand words".

Last time I checked, desk tidiness is not included in typical performance
reviews though.
