I was looking forward to drafting a long document in LaTeX via
[LyX](https://www.lyx.org/).

But then the printer refused to connect to Wi-Fi. There was not enough time to
fix it.

So I wrote a manuscript on paper. It is like magic...writing with a pen. Slowly.
Technology, in the last couple of years, has made me lose the sense of pleasure
in doing so.

Surely there's no erase feature but, somehow, my mind feels intrinsically
connected with the paper. The ink, as it flows, relieves tension and retains
intent.

None of it was intentional though. LaTeX is my favorite digital way to feel
intimate with virtual fonts and pixels. And it's faster to type in a keyboard
than to write with a pen.
