A (small) index on how to travel by train in Europe.

## Search ðŸ”Ž

How to search for train routes?

### Country & Provider agnostic

- [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/)
- [Omio](https://www.omio.com/)
- [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/)
- [Fahrplan Guru](https://www.fahrplan.guru/)
- [Deutsche Bahn (DB) International search](https://int.bahn.de/) (YMMV)
- [Rail Europe](https://www.raileurope.com/)

These providers also include bus routes (e.g. via [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.com/)).

Some of them also include ridesharing (e.g. via [BlaBlaCar](https://www.blablacar.com/)).

There's no point in searching in all of them: pick one or two and call it a day.

[Google Flights](https://flights.google.com/) occasionally displays train routes but it's imperfect, as it's focused on flights.

### Country-specific

This list is intentionally non-exhaustive.

- [Deutsche Bahn (DB)](https://int.bahn.de/en/) for Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
- [Ã–BB](https://www.oebb.at/en/) for Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹
- [SNCF](https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en/) for France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
- [ÄŒD.cz](https://www.cd.cz/en/) for Czech Republic ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿
- [NS](https://www.ns.nl/en) for the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±
- [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/en) for Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­

Sometimes a given train route is cheaper in a different provider.
For example, the _MÃ¼nchen â€“ Praha_ route is generally cheaper on ÄŒD than on DB.

## Savings opportunities

In Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, consider the [Deutschland Ticket](https://int.bahn.de/en/offers/regional/deutschland-ticket) (DL-Ticket).
A single monthly ticket allows you to travel by train throughout the entire country, so long as you don't use express (ICE / EC) trains (i.e. only regional trains).
It also allows you to use unlimited local transit (e.g. U-Bahn = subway / metro, S-Bahn = surface trains, Trams = StraÃŸenbahnen = Street Cars, Buses) a.k.a. Ã–PNV.

In Europe, [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en) / [Eurail](https://www.eurail.com/en) provides passes for multi-day journeys at a discount.
There are several kinds of passes, some of them for travel within a single country, others for multiple countries. [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/passes?source=hweb&countryOfResidence=DE&countryToVisit=interrail-one-country-pass-italy) also sells them.

## Timetables and Live Maps
