to use executable scripts instead of shell aliases:

I've been slowly doing the same. From his post, adapted:

**Main Benefits**:

- No need to source your shell rc after adding new scripts
  - Use immediately without reloading your shell
- No need to edit your shell rc, just drop executable files in `$HOME/.bin` (already in my `$PATH`)
  - Faster iteration (edit script, re-run command, repeat)
- Can be used out-of-the-box with `fd` / `find` / `xargs` and friends

Another recommendation:

Brandon Rhodes: [Start all of your commands with a comma](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/):

I used to do this with prefixes (`t-` because of my first name initial, and then
[`sd-`](https://ianthehenry.com/posts/sd-my-script-directory/)), but a
non-alphabetic character is more compelling.
