**Problem statement**: I have one web browser for work, and another web browser
for personal use. These are two distinct web browsers, not two distinct profiles
    in the same browser. Route work-related links to the work web browser, and
    vice-versa. This is on macOS.

[Finicky](https://github.com/johnste/finicky) addresses it very well:

> A macOS app for customizing which browser to start

It is an app. Install it via homebrew: `brew install finicky`.

Create a config file (`~/.config/finicky/finicky.js`) for it:

```js
// Finicky configuration
// https://github.com/johnste/finicky

module.exports = {
  defaultBrowser: "Brave Browser", // pick your poison
  handlers: [
    {
      // Open Azure, GitHub, Atlassian and company-related domains in Chrome
      match: [
        "*.atlassian.net/*",
        "*.{company_intranet}/*",
        "*.{company}.com/*",
        "*{company}*",
        "github.com/{company_org}*",
        "portal.azure.com/*",
      ],
      browser: "Google Chrome",
    },
  ],
};
```

Now make Finicky your default system browser.

That's it. Now links will open be properly routed, automagically, upon clicking.
