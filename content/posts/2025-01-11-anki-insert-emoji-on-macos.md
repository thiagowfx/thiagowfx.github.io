There's a longstanding bug in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) on macOS: it's
not possible to insert an emoji in the editor view via the system emoji picker.

Whenever you click an emoji, the emoji picker closes whilst nothing is inserted.

This has always annoyed me.

Today I found a
[workaround](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/macos-emoji-picker-not-working-in-editor-view/4061) (thanks Luc!):

It works indeed!

My previous alternative was to use the emoji picker to insert an emoji in
another application (e.g. the Notes.app), and then manually cut and paste it.
