When is the best time...

- to move countries?
- to have a baby?
- to switch jobs?
- to find a new apartment?
- to start a new hobby?
- to try out a new sport?
- to get promoted?
- to call your loved ones?
- to catch up with a long-time friend?
- to travel?
- to bootstrap a company?
- to join an open source community?
- to attend a beloved conference?
- to pray?
- to smile?
- to delete your social media accounts?
- to declutter and tidy up?
- to get that new haircut?

It turns out, [it's never a good
time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow).

There's always something happening in the world.

There's always an inconvenience.

An excuse.

An obstacle.

An inertia field exerting its effect in the entire environment.

When is a good time?

If you wait for it for too long, suddenly it may end up being too late.
