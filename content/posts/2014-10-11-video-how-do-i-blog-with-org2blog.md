**TL;DR**: Video link: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/108656001). This is my blogging
workflow with **Wordpress**, **Emacs** and **org2blog**. Example markup:

```
* **bold**
* _italics_
* `code`
```

Code:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## A new section

Text in the new section.

## Another section

Text in another section. Those are usually the formatting and commands I most
use. There are others, of course, but this is usually a fast (and comfortable!)
way of writing. You should also notice that Emacs automatically break lines for
me! Now, let's post this post. I'll post the video link soon.
