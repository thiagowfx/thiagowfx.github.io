One of the coolest sports in the world I've become acquainted with is
[Badminton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton). In the beginning it is
quite odd to understand its finesse, but after a while it gets easily
internalized and becomes quite natural.

You can play it in singles or in doubles. Arguably most of the fun happens when
playing in doubles. You're supposed to develop synergy with your court partner
and understand their play style, and then adapt accordingly. The style need not
be immutable: it's perfectly fine (and common, even) to change tactics as the
game progresses.

I love how I can express myself freely in the court, whilst have little regard
to formal expectations. I can comfortably (and on-demand) change hands, jump,
squat, put either foot forward, serve the shuttle short or long, position myself
close to the center or close to the edge of the court, go left and right or
backwards and forward. The sky is the limit for freedom and creativity of
movements. It's like a dance wherein you get fully immersed, borderline poetic.

Few sports give you this much freedom to express yourself as you see fit.
