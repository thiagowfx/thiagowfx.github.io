My Kagi trial is going to expire within 2 days.

[Previously]({{< ref "2025-05-04-kagi" >}}), I wrote:

My company approved my request to expense it, therefore I am going to buy their
[1-year Professional plan](https://kagi.com/pricing).

Now, a few observations:

- Would I pay for it out of my own pocket? Probably no. It's perfectly
  reasonable and enough for my purposes to use a blend of [DuckDuckGo + ChatGPT
  Search]({{< ref "2024-12-24-switching-from-google-to-chatgpt-search" >}}).
  That said, Kagi provides extra value to me on top of that duo; I prefer using
  it.

- Once you grow accustomed with search results without ads it's very, very hard
  to go back. Searching on Google suddenly feels like a thing of the past. It's
  very similar to the experience of getting used to ad-blocking software in the
  web browser and then suddenly turning them off. The Web feels messy and
  bloated.

- I did 961 searches at the time of this post, with 18 assistant interactions. I
  barely use their AI features because I prefer the OpenAI ChatGPT experience.
  Nonetheless, their AI features are occasionally handy and I find them to be
  integrated in a non-intrusive way.

**TL;DR**: Go for Kagi iff you can expense it. This is not a sponsored post. :)
