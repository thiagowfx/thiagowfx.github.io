The title is [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code)'s
favorite compliment to me.

I've been slowly incorporating Claude Code as part of my daily workflow, as you
can see below:

Spending $10 USD a day is becoming commonplace.

I could continue this post with generic AI advice[^3], but I am too tired of reading
about it myself.

The hype is still overblown and exhausting, and it doesn't seem like it will
fade out anytime soon (if ever). Nonetheless, opportunistic use of the
technology, whilst (still) staying reasonably distant[^1] from it, does not
hurt[^2].

[^1]: In other words: _without_ getting addicted to it / heavily dependent on
    it.
[^2]: Technically and pedantically speaking it does hurt the planet though :/
[^3]: Do you know what would be _actually_ useful? Tax advice on how to deduct
    software expenses related to AI. Why is no one talking about this?!
