Today I _incidentally_ learned it's possible to take a screenshot from your Kindle
Paperwhite.

> To take a screenshot on your Kindle Paperwhite, hold your fingers on either

> corners. You'll see the screen flash briefly, similar to taking a screenshot
> on iPhone and iPad.

I figured it is possible upon connecting it to my computer and seeing a
screenshot file there. I must have done it accidentally at some point.
