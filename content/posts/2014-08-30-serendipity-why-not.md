Today I'm switching the main language of this (we)blog from Portuguese to
English. To make this change consistent, I've also changed its title, from "O
que venho aprendendo" to "Everyday Serendipity". I love(d) this title. Just
thought of it today, while in the bus. It has **everything** to do with me (that
doesn't mean you should brute force my passwords with this word...), and I was
searching for something that would represent me since the first day I created a
post here. But I could only discover it now.

[The Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity) about
**serendipity**. Main reasons for that change of languages include but are not
limited to:

* I have more visitors from outside than inside of Brazil;
* Most of the Brazilian people that I know who read this blog understand
  English anyways (but the converse is not true);
* After writing in English for a while, I've finally managed to increase my
  confidence in the language and practice it more and more, so why not
  continue it here?
* Most of what I write here is usually inspired by other blogs or sources also
  written in English

So, this change looks pretty natural to me. This doesn't mean I won't write in
Portuguese anymore. I might do it. Anytime. I am also thinking about doing the
same thing with my English speaking…that is, I might create videocasts in
English about a subject that I know reasonably well (such as…Emacs or Arch Linux
look like good candidates). What do you think about it? We'll see what will
happen. Thanks for reading.
