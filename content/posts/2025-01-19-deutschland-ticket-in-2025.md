This post is written as a reference for friends who would visit me in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

If you come for at least 7 days and intend to use public transit (which is
_excellent_!) _and_ travel to outside the city center e.g. to do some
sightseeing and/or hiking, you should _probably_ get the [Deutschland
Ticket](https://www.bahn.de/angebot/regio/deutschland-ticket).

The DL-Ticket is purely for public transit. It's not a CityCard for a CityPass
or similar i.e. no access to museums and/or other attractions. Such a card
[exists](https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-and-fares/tickets-daytickets/muenchen-card/index.html),
but I cannot vouch for it at this time. I have the impression it's only worth it
if you intend to pack _a lot_ of activities within a shorter period of 2-5 days.

The DL-Ticket used to cost 49â‚¬ per month until December 2024. Since January 2025
it costs 58â‚¬ per month (a ~15% increase).

Is this a lot? I can give you some data points for Munich, Bavaria:

- A weekly ticket within the main zone ('M') in Munich costs ~20â‚¬.
- A one-way ticket from the airport costs (zone 'M-5') ~15â‚¬[^1].
- **Therefore**: Two one-way airport tickets + one weekly ticket equals 50â‚¬.

Another data point: a Munich monthly ticket within zone 'M' costs ~68â‚¬.

This is not an exhaustive list of all possibilities to get tickets: it's also
possible to buy group tickets by pooling people together so that the total can be even
cheaper. However, it can get complicated quite fast, and it's likely not worth
the vacation stress to stay on top of German bureaucracy. This is why I would
recommend to simply get the DL-Ticket, without thinking too much, if you'll stay
for 7+ days.

Another benefit of the DL-Ticket is that it allows you to take pretty much
(almost) _any_ public transit within Germany. The previously mentioned monthly
ticket within the zone 'M' in Munich is only valid within certain parts of
Munich. The DL-Ticket, on the other hand, is valid in Berlin, Frankfurt,
Hamburg, Dresden...that's why it's much more cost-effective (and simpler!) than
fiddling with other ticket combinations. And this includes going for
long-distance regional train trips departing from Munich.

What is "public transit"? In Germany, it's split into local transit ("Ã–PNV") and
long-distance transit ("Fernverkehr"). In my definition:

Local transit:

- S-Bahn = surface trains (S1, S2, S3, ...)
- U-Bahn = underground / subway / metro (U1, U2, U3, ...)
- StraÃŸenbahn = tram = light rail = street cars (these have numbers e.g. 12, 16,
  17)
- Bus (these have numbers: e.g. 53, 153)

Long-distance transit:

- Regional trains: go from a city to another (RB, RE)
- Inter-city express trains: same, but faster and skipping many cities along the
  way. These are often dubbed "ICs" or "ICEs"

Regional trains (e.g. RE6) are _in general_ included within the DL-Ticket. There
are [exceptions](https://int.bahn.de/en/faq/deutschlandticket-which-trains)
though (this is _bureaucratic_ Germany!):

> The Deutschland-Ticket can be used throughout Germany on all local trains such
> as RB, RE, S-Bahn trains (SPNV) and also on public transport such as buses,
> trams, subways, etc. (Ã–PNV) of the participating state tariffs, transit
> authorities and transport companies in accordance with the area of validity
> and their conditions for any number of journeys. This applies regardless of
> which transport company, transit authority or national tariff is noted on the
> ticket itself. A Deutschland-Ticket purchased in Munich, for example, can
> therefore also be used for journeys in Frankfurt and the surrounding area.

> Please note, however, that the Deutschland-Ticket is generally not valid on
> trains operated by DB Fernverkehr AG or other long-distance providers such as
> FlixTrain (e.g. IC, EC, ICE, but also RE of DB Fernverkehr AG). DB Fernverkehr

> about exceptions on certain sections of the route.

Consult the link above, which contains [this
PDF](https://assets.static-bahn.de/dam/jcr:35c032ce-e559-4b4d-82ce-ce207d374b45/20231221_Geltungsbereich-D-Ticket.pdf),
to be 100% sure. Or just keep it simple: accept that ~98% (citation needed) of
all available regional trains are within scope, and hope for the best[^2].

Now that you were fully convinced to purchase a DL-Ticket, assuming that you
didn't already regret trying to understand the rules, how do you get one in the
first place?

You could get it physically, but no one[^3] does that. You cannot get one from a
ticket machine. You should get it digitally, and then it becomes available in
your phone. If you get inspected then you just show a QR code from your phone.

There are two practical ways I would suggest to get it digitally:

1. [AutoBus
   Oberbayern](https://deutschland-ticket.store/autobus-oberbayern?lang=en):
   It's possible to make it automatically cancel within one month. ("Single
   ticket only: Your subscription will be cancelled directly, you will receive
   only one ticket for the selected month"). Normally, the DL-Ticket is a
   monthly subscription ("Abo"), and cancelling it is somewhat of a hassle[^4].
   Foreign credit cards are accepted, as well as SEPA Direct Debit.

2. [Mopla](https://en.mopla.solutions/): By default it is a monthly
   subscription, but it's very easy to pause and/or cancel it. It accepts credit
   cards, Apple Pay and PayPal.

I would recommend 1) for guests with a short stay and 2) for people who would
stay in Germany for a longer period (e.g. a few months). Some people I know who
_live_ in Germany also opt for 2), instead of a more traditional Deutsche Bahn
(DB) or MVG subscription, because Mopla makes it trivial to pause the
subscription at any time, whilst other providers require you to time your
cancellation before a specific cut-off day (typically the 10th day of the
previous month) before it gets automatically renewed.

One caveat of Mopla: it _seems_ you need to have your App Store set to Germany
in order to use its app. I could not verify that personally, but see the
[source](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/deutschland-ticket).

Last but not least: the validity of the DL-Ticket counts on a per calendar month
basis, i.e. January 2025, February 2025, and so on. If you're arriving, say, on
Jan 28th, then you're out of luck. It's not possible to make it count for "30
days from now".

If the information above isn't enough, I suggest to read up more on [All About
Berlin](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/deutschland-ticket) which summarizes
it better than I do.

Ah, and what if you only visit for only a few days, less than a week? Then the
best cost-benefit really depends, and it's harder to make a general
recommendation. I would be happy to make a suggestion depending on the amount of
people, how you are arriving (e.g. main train station versus main airport), when
(time of day) you are arriving, and what are your travel plans.

_Auf wiederlesen!_

[^1]: In practice it's possible to buy an _Anschluss Ticket_ ("additional
    ticket") alongside the zone 'M' weekly ticket, which costs ~9â‚¬ for the '1-5'
    zone range, which is the one you need to complement to get to the Munich
    city center from the MUC airport. Therefore, to be pedantic, the total cost
    would actually be ~(9â‚¬ + 9â‚¬ + 20â‚¬) = ~38â‚¬.

    can you use the ticket. Tip: The mobile ticket is usually available within
    48 hours.

    our Aboportal (subscription portal) or the "Cancel subscription" function in
    the DB Navigator below your mobile phone ticket.
