After owning an iPhone 14 Pro for more than two and a half years, its maximum
battery capacity degraded to **~76%**. It is not a terrible number, but the
general recommendation is to take action whenever it goes below **80%**, which
happened a couple of months ago.

In this state I am forced to carry a portable charger wherever I go if I want
to keep my peace of mind and eliminate "battery anxiety".

The natural course of action for many at this point would be to simply buy the
newest and shiniest iPhone.

Yet, I love to fight against [planned
obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence), and will
happily do what I can, even if it yields a bit of friction.

One of my favorite aspects of being an iPhone user is the ability to get superb
support from Apple[^1]. In particular, they have a [battery
replacement](https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-replacement)
program.

All you have to do is:

- schedule an appointment in the Genius Bar,
- bring your iPhone there,
- and then retrieve it a couple of hours later[^2].

Is it cost effective? Hell yes. I paid about 10% of the original purchase
price, and it's like I just got a brand new iPhone.

[^1]: But only if I am ~~privileged~~ lucky enough to live in a city that has
    one.
[^2]: In my case, 3 hours.
