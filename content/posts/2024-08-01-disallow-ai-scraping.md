Although there's never a guarantee, you can attempt to disallow "AI" from
scraping the posts in your blog, in the same spirit of "DNT - Do Not Track" in
modern web browsers.

If you have control over your
[`robots.txt`](https://perrotta.dev/robots.txt)[^1],
add something like the following to it:

```
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User

User-agent: CCBot

User-agent: Google-Extended

User-agent: Claude-Web

User-agent: ClaudeBot

User-agent: cohere-ai
Disallow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot

User-agent: FacebookBot
Disallow: /

# Default rule
User-agent: *

```

The list above is non-exhaustive and will not be kept up-to-date, it's just
meant as a reference and/or starting point.

You could always use Gen AI itself to help you populate it, credits go to
