Dear reader, this place reached more than a year of existence, and this is a
milestone I never dreamed of. I always thought that I would only blog for a few
months. However, here I still am.

I always emphasize that this is a **personal** blog, therefore its posts are not
necessarily optimized to please you—they are optimized to be clear, reflecting
my thoughts as precisely as possible. Yet here are almost 10k views.

Views are not super important because I don't win anything with ads (on
purpose), but they of course motivate me to continue writing here. Now, as you
are with me, I decided it would be a good idea to listen to you. There is a
Google Docs form where you can say things you like and dislike on this blog, and
also suggest future topics.

If you have some time, please respond. Thanks!
