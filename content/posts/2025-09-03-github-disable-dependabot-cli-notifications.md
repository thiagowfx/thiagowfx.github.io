Good morning!

```

These are simply non-actionable by our team; we have a dedicated security team
to look into these matters. Even worse: the constant output makes us accustomed
to it, until it becomes background noise.

GitHub allows us to
[disable](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-notifications-for-dependabot-alerts#configuring-notifications-for-dependabot-alerts)
these CLI notifications: Settings > Notifications
> System > "Dependabot alerts: New vulnerabilities" > "Notify me": "on GitHub"
> only.
