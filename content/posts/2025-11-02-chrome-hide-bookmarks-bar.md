It is a good practice to [hide the bookmarks
bar](https://www.jakeworth.com/tils/hide-bookmarks-bar-in-chrome/) in Chrome in
certain scenarios:

- when taking screenshots
- when sharing your screen during presentations or video calls
- when you need to focus and/or avoid distractions

It can be done with `Cmd + Shift + b`. I use this shortcut all the time.

Alternatively: Menu > Bookmarks and Lists > Hide Bookmarks Bar.
