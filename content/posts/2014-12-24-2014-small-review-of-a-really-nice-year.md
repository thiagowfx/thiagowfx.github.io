**Disclaimer**: I haven't reviewed this post. It was written in one shot. I hope
it is understandable.

This is possibly the last post from me on this platform. However, I've said that
a thousand times before. I've tried many platforms: Google Sites, Jekyll, nanoc,
and Octopress.

Last year I wrote a similar post. Now, here I will register some small changes,
tidbits, and bits I've learned and discovered this year. I won't create
links—just pure text.

## The actual post

Detailing everything would be tough, so I present this as lists, trying to be
chronologically organized and reasonably brief.

### Campus Party

This was my first great event. In particular:

- I participated in a hackathon for the first time. It was from Mozilla, and my
  code is on GitHub in the "Riddlefox" repository. It's a riddle game for
  Firefox OS.
- I participated in my first Capture the Flag (CTF) competition, without knowing
  it was a CTF. Promoted by CERT.br, I won a Kindle Paperwhite 2, ending in
  second place. Today, the Kindle is one of the devices I use most.
- I opened my eyes to communities thanks to open source communities at this
  event. Today, I'm an active member of the Arch Linux community.
- I opened my eyes to web development. I'm not a super fan yet, but it's on my
  planning list.

### Arch Linux

I was searching for a community to settle on for two years. The Arch
Linux community is perfect for me. I learned:

- Communities
- MediaWiki syntax/style
- IRC for open source projects
- The importance of the command line
- The importance of "do it yourself" and not feeding help vampires
- Sometimes user-centered > user-friendly
- The feeling of knowing intelligent people and becoming more intelligent with them
- Tiling window managers are awesome (currently using i3)
- Mailing lists

### Programming languages

One of my goals this year. Languages I learned include, in order: emacs lisp,
cmake, golang, javascript/node.js, ruby, haskell, Matlab, and R.

The most important things are the paradigms:

- Haskell: functional programming
- Golang: systems programming
- Ruby: dynamic programming

My goal for next year is more depth-first than breadth-first. I want to improve
my knowledge in some of these languages, probably digging deeper on Haskell.

### MOOCs

I became more interested in them month by month. Coursera is my preferred
platform, though I learned to like edx. The best MOOC this year was on
Functional Programming using Haskell, conducted by Erik Meijer.

### Presentations

LaTeX + beamer became my de facto standard. For collaborative editing, Google
Docs/Slides continues to be the best. LyX is my preferred tool.

### Books and reading

This year was great. My Goodreads profile tells me I read 50 books this year,
almost double from last year (26 books). Most were technical.

- I can't live without Goodreads anymore.
- You don't need to buy books on Amazon for a Kindle. I've never bought one.
  Epub and mobi are the best formats.
- I can't live without Calibre anymore.

### Operating systems

I learned more about FreeBSD, grml (a nice distro for system administrators),
and other Linux distros. Now I try to say Unix and *nix instead of just Linux.

Docker and containers are simply amazing. They will be the future. I also played
with filesystems like btrfs and xfs.

### Games

Not a great year for games. The only one worth playing was Tom Clancy's Splinter
Cell: Conviction. Kongregate is slowly dying.

### Music

Spotify was my best discovery of the year. I'm trying to listen to different
music genres. I also discovered blockify for blocking audio ads on Spotify
(though I don't recommend it—Spotify is a great service offered for free).

The podcasts I most like is Bad Voltage (presented by Jono Bacon, Jeremy Garcia,
Bryan Lunduke and Stuart Landridge).

### Computer graphics

I created a game (repository "cg-sokoban") and developed a ray-tracer. OpenGL
wasn't the most exciting thing I learned, but I got interested in game engines
and image processing/computer vision.

### Vim and Emacs

The epic battle continues. I switched to vim for most daily text editing needs
this year. However, I'm not done with emacs. My personal rule: if your editing
task takes less than an hour, vim is better; otherwise emacs is better.

### Hackathons

I participated in my first hackathon with a team; my team got best place in a
specific category (HackPuc).

### Android

I learned tricks to optimize it. I have the same device (Motorola Razr I) for
almost 2 years, and it's still fast. Root is necessary for maintenance.

### Privacy

Privacy becomes a concern more and more. I became an adopter of OpenPGP and I'm
trying to move away from the Gmail web client. I'm using msmtp for sending
emails, but I still need a more complete stack.

### Social networks

Facebook is becoming deprecated. My news feed is blocked from the web. Most of
my contacts are boring, narcissistic, and futile.

- **Twitter**: Better as a news feed than Facebook, though I never interacted
  with most people I follow.
- **Tumblr**: Now using it for sharing links instead of Facebook.
- **Flickr**: My preferred place for photos. Flickr is the best place for
  sharing photos, though this may change.
- **Reddit and Hacker News**: Still the best sources of serendipity I know.
- **RSS feeds**: Using Inoreader now. XKCD is probably the best RSS feed.

### Podcasts

This year was huge for podcasts. I have 47 podcast feeds, a ridiculous number. I
listen regularly to ~15 of them. I'm adapting to listening at 2x speed. Some I
listen at 2.5x.

### Languages

One of the best things I did was write in this blog in English. This improved
much the way I think in English. What's next? I'm thinking about studying French
or German.

### Orgmode

The best TODO/agenda/organizer I discovered. Both for discipline and structuring
your thoughts and plans.

## The future starts with you

This was probably the largest post I written in this blog. I'm pretty satisfied.
I covered most of the things I thought. I haven't talked about
everything—programming contests, hackergroup, bookmarks, dotfiles, repositories,
what I hated and loved to learn, professors, and the GPA system.

In this year, more than halfway through my college degree, several things became
clear about my next steps. The next year I'll probably study more computer
graphics, computer networks, programming languages, and algorithms.

What is the future of this place? I don't know. However, I tried to stop several
times. This means something. I'm not 100% comfortable with using Wordpress. I'm
getting bored of this format/style.

For all of this, I'm migrating to https://thiagowfx.github.io/archive. I'll
change the way I post too. If you follow by RSS, keep it in your feed list for a
while until the new blog gets its own feed. The best way to get in touch with me
    is by following me on Twitter (@thiagowfx).

I wish you a good New Year. Let's move on.

**Observation**: I'm on vacation. I'm open to study groups or business. If you
want to study something with me or want me to work for you, this is a nice
moment.
