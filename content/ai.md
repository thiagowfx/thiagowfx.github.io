This page summarizes the usage of LLMs ("Gen AI") in this blog.

I **handcraft** every post by myself, and choose subjects of my own interest.
I've been doing this even before LLMs, and will continue to do so.

I **do not** use an LLM spellchecker; only `vim`'s `:spell`.

I **do not** use LLMs to help me iterate on blog posts, including their title
and content.

Agentic LLMs are occasionally used in the context of design, tooling and
infrastructure of this site.
