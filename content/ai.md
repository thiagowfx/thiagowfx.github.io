This page summarizes the usage of LLMs ("Gen AI") in this blog.

I **handcraft** every post, and choose subjects of my interest. I've been doing
this way before LLMs, and will continue to do so. I get a lot out of
it.

I **do not** use an LLM spellchecker. There's only `vim`'s `:spell`.

I **do not** use an LLM to help me iterate on my posts, title and content
included.
