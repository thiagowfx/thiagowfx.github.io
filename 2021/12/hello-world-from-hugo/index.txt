Hello World from [Hugo][hugo]!

I am joining the [indieweb][indieweb] and the [JAMStack][jamstack] by rolling my
own blog backed by a static site generator ([SSG][ssg]) and deployed with `git`.

Previously I used to have a blog hosted on Wordpress
called [Everyday Serendipity](https://everydayserendipity.wordpress.com).
