There are many analytics and tracking offerings for blogs. I don't want any of
them.

In this umpteenth iteration of my personal blog, I realized from the start that
I would be much happier by not having any anxiety related to trying to figure
out how many visitors I have.

It's such a peace of mind to write just for the sake of writing.

A public blog is not a journal, yet it plays its own role in the grand scheme of
things.

The world would be a happier place if we cared less about numbers; or, at least,
certain numbers, such as Instagram / Twitter / TikTok followers, or story views,
or blog post impressions.

The obvious and most sensible exception is when(ever) you have a business or a
brand. Then it is important to stay in the know, when your revenue depends on
it.
