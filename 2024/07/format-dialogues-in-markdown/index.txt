I wanted to add a new kind of post to this blog, wherein I transcribe
conversations (a dialogue).

Initially, I formatted conversations like this:

- Alice: Hi
- Bob: Hello

In code:

```markdown
- Alice: Hi
- Bob: Hello
```

But that's just an ordinary list.

I thought about using em-dashes next, but they were meh (–).

Then the lazy web helped me with inspirations, and I settled with the following
format:

> **Alice**: Hi
>
> **Bob**: Hello

In code:

```markdown
> **Alice**: Hi
>
> **Bob**: Hello
```

It combines blockquotes with bolding the speaker. Simple, yet effective.
