podcast RSS feeds.
I follow Jovem Nerd - Nerdcasts.
They are a Brazilian podcast.
However, in the recent years, they added a lot of other (unrelated) podcasts
from their network to the main NerdCast feed, effectively polluting it. The
cleaner and elegant action to do would have been to publish individual RSS feeds
for each of their podcast series, and perhaps an additional one to contain all
of them, for those who would like to subscribe to everything. But that&rsquo;s not
what they do."><meta name=keywords content="dev,selfhosted,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://perrotta.dev/2024/07/pipes-rss-manipulation/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="not just serendipity"><meta property="og:title" content="Pipes: RSS Manipulation"><meta property="og:description" content="Yahoo!
