enjoyable,
but it&rsquo;s an enjoyable waste of time. They will have no impact on my actions one
way or another.</p></blockquote><p>[&mldr;]</p><blockquote><p>My life does not seem to be impoverished for it; indeed, I think it has been
greatly enhanced. But I haven&rsquo;t found many other people who are willing to
take the plunge.</p></blockquote><p>How relevant these words of wisdom still are!</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t been closely following the news ever since the great pandemic™. This
includes social media, apple / google news, and portals from news organizations.
I go out of my way to prevent the constant barrage of unnecessary anxiety and
fearmongering from affecting me.</p><p>There are other ways to stay up-to-date with relevant topics.</p><p>My primary sources are:</p><ul><li>the excellent <a href=https://miniflux.app/>miniflux</a>, my beloved RSS reader. As of
the time of this publication, I am following 350+ feeds. Quantity is not an
important metric here, especially as most of these feeds do not publish daily</li><li>local news. These are the most impactful ones, as they affect the environment
where I live and could thus influence or change my short or medium-term
planning</li><li>friends & family, mostly via chat apps through individual conversations or
group chats</li></ul><p>There is rarely a need for immediate action. Furthermore the news that are
<em>truly</em> important or relevant end up spreading like fire, to the point where
it&rsquo;s impossible not to have heard of them.</p><p><strong>Corollary</strong>: Life is short, make a better use of your time. There are plenty
of ways to do so<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>!</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>citation needed, you do you&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></content><p><a href=https://perrotta.dev/tags/meta/>#meta</a>
