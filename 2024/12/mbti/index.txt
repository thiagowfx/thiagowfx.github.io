https://dynomight.net/mbti/ has the "fastest mbti test".

Indeed, it's quite concise and minimalist.

In case you are not familiar with it:

> Tendencies
>
> Introverts (I) direct their energy inwards, to ideas and thoughts. Extroverts (E) direct their energy outwards, towards people, things, and situations.
> Sensing people (S) prefer tangible facts. Intuitive people (N) prefer abstractions and theories.
> Feelers (F) look at situations through empathy for the people involved. Thinkers (T) look at situations from a more detached, logical viewpoint.
> Judging people (J) prefer a planned and structured approach to life. Perceiving people (P) prefer to be more spontaneous.

website.

I got myself "tested" again and the results stayed consistent, as you would
expect.
