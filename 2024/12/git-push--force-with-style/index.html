git push --force: This command forcefully pushes your changes to the remote
branch, even if it results in overwriting or losing commits. It does not
consider the current state of the remote branch. If someone else has pushed
changes to the same branch in the meantime, their changes will be lost.


git push --force-with-lease: This command is a safer alternative to git push
— force. It will only force push if the remote branch matches your
expectations. It checks if someone else has pushed changes to the branch in
the meantime. If the branch on the remote repository has not diverged (i.e.,
no new commits were pushed by others), your push will be allowed. If someone
else has pushed changes, the push will be rejected, ensuring you do not
accidentally overwrite someone else&rsquo;s work."><meta name=keywords content="dev,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://perrotta.dev/2024/12/git-push--force-with-style/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="not just serendipity"><meta property="og:title" content="git: push --force with style"><meta property="og:description" content="TIL:

Overflow</a>
to the rescue&mldr;</p><blockquote><p>I just learned about <code>git push --force-with-lease</code>. It&rsquo;s pretty awesome. But,
of course, I don&rsquo;t use force that often, and so I&rsquo;m worried that I might
forget about this nifty feature the next time I need it. Is there a way to
configure git so git push -f will automatically use <code>--force-with-lease</code>
unless I intentionally override it with <code>--no-force-with-lease</code>?</p></blockquote><p>&mldr;amen, you read my mind, OP!</p><p>The accepted answer, to my despair:</p><blockquote><p>There currently is no way to configure git to always use force-with-lease
instead of force. As such the next best available option is, as so often, to
create an alias which serves this purpose.</p></blockquote></content><p><a href=https://perrotta.dev/tags/dev/>#dev</a></p></main><footer><span>© 2021 - 2025 <a href=mailto:tbperrotta@gmail.com>Thiago Perrotta</a> <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>Some Rights Reserved</a> · <a href=/index.xml>RSS</a> · a fork of <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ bear</a></span></footer></body></html>
