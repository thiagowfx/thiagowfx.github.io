And also for how many didn&rsquo;t.</p><ul><li>Browser: Google Chrome on macOS, Chromium on Linux, Safari on iOS.</li><li>Search: A combination of Google and DuckDuckGo (mostly for their <a href=https://duckduckgo.com/bangs>!bangs</a>).</li><li>Writing: A combination of VSCode, <code>vim</code> and <a href=https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit>MarkEdit</a> (macOS markdown app). I never got around to long-form writing in Obsidian or Logseq, however it&rsquo;s something I strive to.</li><li>Cloud File Storage: There&rsquo;s no need to share this. Basic OpSec. Why would people share it?</li><li>Chat: WhatsApp remains king in terms of popularity, despite Telegram being superior from an architectural and usability perspective for power users. Facebook Messenger is officially dead at this point. And I&rsquo;m too much of a millennial for all other apps (Discord, Matrix, etc). Disappearing messages exist in all of these, except Instagram.</li><li>Scheduling: There&rsquo;s no real choice here. You use the platform your employer uses. Otherwise, Google Calendar is the most sensible choice other than self-hosting.</li><li>Video Calls: Ditto. I am way too used to Google Meet to justify switching to an alternative at this point.</li><li>Music: Spotify, hands down. YouTube Music is a good fallback. There&rsquo;s no need to pay for YouTube Premium for music, do your research.</li><li>Podcasts: Overcast on iOS.</li><li>Password Management: Once again, why would you share this?</li><li>Code Editor: VScode and <code>vim</code>. Maybe I&rsquo;ll switch to <code>neovim</code> at some point. I refrain from using IDEs in general but, when I need to, JetBrains is the answer. I tried <a href=https://zed.dev/><code>zed</code></a> this year but wasn&rsquo;t convinced, and their core team is quite small. The flurry of &ldquo;AI&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> editors should be ignored, as none of them are likely to stick long-term. Instead, it&rsquo;s better to invest in &ldquo;AI&rdquo; tooling that is editor agnostic; for example, Simon Willison&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/simonw/llm><code>llm</code></a>, or GitHub Copilot.</li><li>Terminal: iTerm2 on macOS. I haven&rsquo;t used desktop linux in a while (:sad:), but I&rsquo;d probably still stick to Tilix and/or Alacritty there. I no longer use hterm (ChromeOS).</li><li>VPN: Unless you&rsquo;re rolling your own, it doesn&rsquo;t matter too much. Avoid the big players if you can afford to.</li><li>Bookmarks: None. <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25614984-spark-joy>Absolutely none</a>. When I need to store <em>transient</em> link lists, I use my Second Brain app to do so.</li><li>Read It Later: Ditto as above. Otherwise: starring articles on Miniflux, or keeping Safari tabs open until I get to them, or parking a handful of items in an &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; browser bookmarks folder.</li><li>Mail Client: The official clients of my email providers. No agnostic app at this time. It&rsquo;s especially inconvenient to do so on iOS.</li><li>Mail Server: N/A.</li><li>Launcher: <code>Cmd-Space</code> on macOS a.k.a. Spotlight. I keep Raycast around but I rarely use it. On Linux <code>i3-dmenu-desktop</code> is still my favorite.</li><li>Screenshots: <code>Cmd-Shift-4</code> on macOS, or <code>scrot</code> on Linux.</li><li>Menu Bar: <a href=https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden>Hidden Bar</a>. It&rsquo;s free, and available as a cask on homebrew.</li><li>Containers: Rancher Desktop.</li><li>Automation: None. I tried Hammerspoon this year but found no use for it.</li><li>Second Brain: A mixture of Obsidian and Logseq. Which I&rsquo;d really like to end, it would be easier to have a single app to rule them all, as they both support multiple vaults / graphs anyway (e.g. to partition personal vs work notes).</li><li>Operating System: <a href=https://alpinelinux.org/>Alpine Linux</a> is my current favorite for servers, and I&rsquo;m biased anyway because I maintain a couple of aports (packages) there. For desktop, it&rsquo;s awfully hard to use anything other than macOS ever since M1 processors got released. I miss Linux desktop from time to time but realistically it&rsquo;s no longer an intrinsic goal of mine; that said, I&rsquo;d likely go back to my beloved Arch Linux should that ever reoccur.</li><li>Shell: <code>zsh</code> + <a href=https://grml.org/zsh/><code>grml-zsh-config</code></a>, no change here. Sometimes I think of migrating to <code>fish</code>, but the POSIX incompability always discourages me to do so.</li><li>Terminal Multiplexer: <code>tmux</code>, but only for remote sessions (<code>ssh</code>). Locally I tend to just open new terminal tabs on VSCode and/or iTerm2. Alas, <code>tmux</code> + <code>VSCode</code> do not play well together anyway (citation needed, for another day).</li></ul><p>This post was inspired by <a href=https://micro.webology.dev/2024/12/19/default-apps.html>https://micro.webology.dev/2024/12/19/default-apps.html</a>.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>For the correct way to refer to them, pick one of: LLMs, Gen AI, or &ldquo;AI&rdquo;. <em>Never</em> drop the quotes when using the plain term!
