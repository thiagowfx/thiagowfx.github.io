Too many advents:

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/): my favorite. See [coding]({{< ref "/categories/coding" >}}).
- [Advent of Papers](https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/advent-of-papers)
- [Debug December](https://www.debugdecember.com/)
- [HTMLHell Advent Calendar](https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/)

Surely you will never run out of daily technical challenges to do in December!

And don't forget about the likes of [Wordly](https://wordly.org/).
