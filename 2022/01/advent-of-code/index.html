Advent of Code by Eric Wastl happens every year since 2015, every December from the 1st to
the 25th. Each day there&rsquo;s a new programming challenge1 split into two
parts. The first part tends to be easier than the second one. The second part
usually builds upon the first one, being a follow-up task that requires more
steps and/or with a higher degree of complexity. You can&rsquo;t always reuse the
bits from the first part to solve the second one though."><meta name=keywords content="aoc,dev,bestof★,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://perrotta.dev/2022/01/advent-of-code/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="not just serendipity"><meta property="og:title" content="Advent of Code"><meta property="og:description" content="Last year I found out about Advent of Code.

the 25th. Each day there&rsquo;s a new programming challenge<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> split into two
parts. The first part tends to be easier than the second one. The second part
usually builds upon the first one, being a follow-up task that requires more
steps and/or with a higher degree of complexity. You can&rsquo;t always reuse the
bits from the first part to solve the second one though.</p><p>For those familiar with programming contests like <a href=https://icpc.global/>ACM ICPC</a> or <a href=https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/>OBI</a>, or online judges like <a href=https://www.spoj.com/>SPOJ</a> or <a href=https://onlinejudge.org/>UVa</a>, advent of code feels like home. The main difference is that there is no time pressure and no need to write spaghetti and unreadable code; in fact, writing readable and elegant solutions is encouraged (<em>citation needed</em>&mldr;).</p><p>For those familiar with FAANG/Tech whiteboard interviews, advent of code feels a lot like a typical interview. I would even go further and say it&rsquo;s a great way to practice for interviews.</p><p>It is a great moment to either (i) learn a new exciting programming language or (ii) improve your mastery on programming languages that you already know. I know several people (see below) that used AoC<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> to learn Rust or Kotlin or whatever else was exciting for them at the time. It&rsquo;s surprising that the official Kotlin Docs even contain a section called <a href=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/advent-of-code.html>Advent of Code puzzles in idiomatic Kotlin</a>.</p><p>Some folks go even further and use it to practice their <a href=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/216024/advent-of-code-2020-day-2-part-1>code golfing</a><sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> or even <a href=https://ryxcommar.com/2021/12/04/advent-of-code-2021-in-google-sheets-first-4-days/>Google Sheets</a> skills. I have a deep amount of respect for them as it&rsquo;s quite a challenge. If you think it stops there, I&rsquo;ve also seen solutions in <a href=https://github.com/phillbush/aoc>awk</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/_rsc/status/1476683352493207561>sed</a>.</p><p>Another positive aspect of AoC is that it has an integrated dashboard that tracks your progress as you go. It&rsquo;s a simple element of gamification that immensely improves motivation and fun. You really feel a big desire to collect all those 50 stars&mldr;</p><h2 id=what-about-me>What about me?</h2><p>My goal for 2021 was relatively less ambitious than that, I just wanted to improve my Python skills, more specifically Python 3. I learned Python 2 during my first year in university and used it sparingly at work and for personal endeavours, but always had a knowledge gap in Python 3.</p><p>I set up a public git repository with <a href=https://github.com/thiagowfx/adventofcode>my solutions</a> and aspired to write simple and elegant python, my only <a href=https://frantic.im/no-constraints-no-fun/>constraint</a> was to limit myself to what is available in the standard library of a vanilla python3 installation in Alpine linux, with the exception of <a href=https://numpy.org/><code>numpy</code></a> which is widespread enough to deserve an entry in my <a href=https://github.com/thiagowfx/adventofcode/blob/master/requirements.txt><code>requirements.txt</code></a>, and of course devtools like debuggers, linters and auto formatters as needed.</p><p>As an additional, non-programming challenge I also limited myself to only use the command line. This basically meant no IDEs<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>. My programming environment was ultimately <code>ssh</code> to an Alpine Linux VPS + <code>tmux</code> + <code>vim</code>. To make my life easier, one of the first tasks I accomplished was to write a generic <a href=https://github.com/thiagowfx/adventofcode/blob/master/Makefile><code>Makefile</code></a> to help me test and run my scripts. A typical invocation would look like:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>$ make DEBUG<span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#ae81ff>1</span> DAY<span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#ae81ff>3</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>&mldr;whereas I could choose between the sample input versus the real one with <code>DEBUG</code>, and the puzzle day with <code>DAY</code>.</p><p>Was the experience worth it? <strong>Definitely yes</strong>! Even though I only completed ~8 puzzles out of the 25 ones due to having my attention split with another project I was working on at the time, the thematic submarine puzzles were hella fun and I learned a lot of python 3 on the way.</p><p>A few highlights of what I learned <em>and used</em> from my python <code>2to3</code> transition were f-strings / string interpolation (<code>print(f'The sum is {sum}')</code>), &ldquo;everything is an iterator now&rdquo; even <code>map</code> and <code>range</code>, the standard library is awesome and sometimes you stumble upon useful abstractions like <code>Counter</code> and <code>defaultdict</code>, <code>sort</code> is different now (<code>key</code> instead of comparison function), this <code>pdb</code> debugger thingy, among other topics I can&rsquo;t remember at the moment. I realized the only concept that was previously familiar was the different syntax of the <code>print</code> function (you have to use parentheses now).</p><p>In terms of workflow, I also learned that virtual environments are now
supported natively<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> (<code>python -m venv</code>), <a href=https://perrotta.dev/2022/01/direnv-automate-your-environment-variables/><code>direnv</code></a> is an amazing tool to
automate/manage environments in git repositories and also happens to have
first-class python integration, <code>pylint</code> and <code>autopep8</code> are good integrations
with <code>vim</code> to help spot basic errors and/or suggest best practices, and <code>numpy</code> takes forever to build from source.</p><h2 id=what-about-the-community>What about the community?</h2><p>AoC enjoys a lot of popularity and zeitgeist, especially during times of the COVID-19 pandemic, but even before then. There&rsquo;s a large <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/>/r/adventofcode</a> subreddit community, lots of people share their solution snippets and impressions on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23adventofcode&amp;src=typed_query">#AdventOfCode</a>), there&rsquo;s a ton of public git repositories on <a href="https://github.com/search?q=adventofcode">GitHub</a> where people share their coding solutions, in pretty much any programming language you can think of, and finally there are many screencasts on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=advent+of+code">YouTube</a>. The Internet in the 2020s sparks creativity in every unimaginable corner.</p><p>There&rsquo;s so much information that it&rsquo;s impossible to stay on top of everything. Here is a small list of repositories that I followed this year, most of those are acquaintances/friends and/or stumbled upon Twitter:</p><p>C++:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/riuri/adventofcode>https://github.com/riuri/adventofcode</a></li></ul><p>Python:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/sjvrijn/AdventofCode>https://github.com/sjvrijn/AdventofCode</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/oomenn/AOC>https://github.com/oomenn/AOC</a></li></ul><p>Rust:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/dimo414/advent-2021>https://github.com/dimo414/advent-2021</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mfs/aoc>https://github.com/mfs/aoc</a></li></ul><p><strong>Edit (2024-08-06)</strong>: Additions from 2022:</p><p>C++:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/eariassoto/advent-of-code-cpp>https://github.com/eariassoto/advent-of-code-cpp</a></li></ul><p>Python:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/achrafmam2/adventofcode>https://github.com/achrafmam2/adventofcode</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/mcerdeiro/aoc2022>https://github.com/mcerdeiro/aoc2022</a></li></ul><p>I find it&rsquo;s really constructive and useful (and also <em>fun</em>) to peek at other people&rsquo;s solutions after I coded my own. I have extensive (albeit kinda rusty these days) experience with C++ so I wanted to follow at least one repository coded with it; since I wrote my solutions in python it was also a natural choice to follow a few python repositories; and, finally, I wanted to peek at some languages I am not familiar with to get a gist of them. This year I watched Rust and a few bits of Clojure and Kotlin on Twitter.</p><p>Finally, for some extra inspiration, there are also some <em>10x programmers</em><sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> out there that seem to be fans of AoC as well: <a href=https://github.com/norvig/pytudes>Peter Norvig</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/_rsc/status/1466089522718986241>Russ Cox (<em>rsc</em>)</a>. There are probably several others I am not aware of.</p><h2 id=final-remarks>Final remarks</h2><p>I am hoping to participate in AoC this year (2022) as well, and possibly revisit the 2021 puzzles and resolve the rest of the ones I missed as time permits.</p><p>Hopefully this post encourages and motivates you to try Advent of Code as well!
