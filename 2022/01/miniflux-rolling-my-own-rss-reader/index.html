Preamble
I always kind of enjoyed following people and blogs via RSS, even though it has never been a key part of my workflow (nor of the mainstream web). That said, I am not here to convince you why RSS is great, there are good existing resources12 for that already.
Initially I had used Commafeed, Feedly and Inoreader, which are hosted solutions. They are mostly OK, especially if you only have a handful of feeds. Their free offerings are quite decent, with a limit of a hundred or so feeds. They also have mobile clients (Android, iOS) which are a must these days. I was never fully converted to them though, and my workflow therein would only last for a few weeks or months. Some common barriers were:"><meta name=keywords content="linux,selfhosted,bestof★,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://perrotta.dev/2022/01/miniflux-rolling-my-own-rss-reader/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="not just serendipity"><meta property="og:title" content="★ Miniflux: Rolling my own RSS Reader"><meta property="og:description" content="This article describes my experience transitioning to, setting up and using the Miniflux RSS reader for the first time.

That said, I am not here to convince you why RSS is great, there are good existing resources<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> for that already.</p><p>Initially I had used Commafeed, Feedly and Inoreader, which are hosted solutions. They are mostly OK, especially if you only have a handful of feeds. Their free offerings are quite decent, with a limit of a hundred or so feeds. They also have mobile clients (Android, iOS) which are a must these days. I was never fully converted to them though, and my workflow therein would only last for a few weeks or months. Some common barriers were:</p><ul><li><p>their recommendations and &lsquo;machine learning&rsquo; fluff were a consistent source of stress, with a fear of missing out (FOMO) akin to social media. I felt pressured to keep following new blogs just like I am pressured to constantly &rsquo;like&rsquo; and &lsquo;follow&rsquo; new pages in traditional American social media.</p></li><li><p>there was a lot of context switching: many upstream RSS feeds aren&rsquo;t great, for example, by providing excerpts (summaries) only I&rsquo;d always have to visit the website directly if I wanted to read full articles. This doesn&rsquo;t scale well long term, attention is a precious resource and our brains aren&rsquo;t great at keeping steady and focused attention if we constantly context switch. A classical feed like this is <a href=http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/feeds/pgessays.rss>Paul Graham&rsquo;s</a>.</p></li><li><p>there was no ability to filter out (exclude) posts from feeds. For example, deleting posts with a certain title (Sponsor, Ad, some boring mainstream topic). A classical example is <a href=https://daringfireball.net/>John Gruber&rsquo;s Daring Fireball</a> sponsored posts which usually have &lsquo;Sponsor&rsquo; in their titles. Why do I have to manually skip these posts, why can&rsquo;t I teach my RSS reader to do it automatically for me?</p></li><li><p>lock-in: whenever I starred/saved posts that I liked for future reference, they would be stuck in the specific cloud provider I chose.</p></li></ul><p>These were some of my gripes.</p><p>During those years I had also tried to self-host <a href=https://tt-rss.org/>TinyTinyRSS</a> but it didn&rsquo;t really last for me:</p><ol><li><p>first, its stack is relatively bloated: hosting and maintaining a typical LAMP stack takes some considerable amount of effort — TinyTinyRSS requires a full PHP installation alongside a webserver (apache, nginx or similar) and a database. Suddenly there was a lot of complexity to maintain all that.</p></li><li><p>second, I didn&rsquo;t have any cloud resources (VPS), nor a local server in my home (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or a NUC or a NAS Appliance). An instance in my personal laptop wouldn&rsquo;t really scale either as I would have needed it to be always on if I wanted to have continuous access to it (e.g. from my phone).</p></li><li><p>third, I wasn&rsquo;t a seasoned sysadmin at the time and wasn&rsquo;t really looking forward to self-host.</p></li></ol><p>Then 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic came along with all of its imposed
government lockdowns worldwide. Suddenly many people had a lot of free time on
their hands.</p><h2 id=self-hosting-at-home>Self-hosting at home</h2><p>Having an <a href=https://archlinux.org/>Arch Linux</a> workstation at home, it felt natural to try out Miniflux there first.</p><p>Miniflux has great upstream <a href=https://miniflux.app/docs/installation.html#debian>documentation</a> already, therefore it&rsquo;s just a matter of following it. It&rsquo;s out of scope of this post to duplicate the installation process here, however I will add a bit of color regarding my initial setup.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Those instructions will probably get out-of-date at some point.</p><p>Thankfully there&rsquo;s already a miniflux <a href=https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/miniflux/>package</a> for Arch, making my job much easier. Installing miniflux alone isn&rsquo;t enough though, we will also need to install a database server (PostgreSQL):</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>$ sudo pacman -Syu miniflux postgresql
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The next step is to configure the PostgreSQL server. Refer to the upstream documentation for that, but the TL;DR is:</p><ul><li>create a <code>miniflux</code> user</li><li>create a <code>miniflux</code> database owned by the <code>miniflux</code> user</li><li>perform a few tweaks (extension hstore)</li></ul><p>Then configure miniflux:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>$ cat /etc/miniflux.conf

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We will also need to create an admin user for miniflux with <code>miniflux --create-admin</code>.</p><p>Then we start the database server and miniflux:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span>$ sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql miniflux
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Afterwards it&rsquo;s just a matter of navigating to http://localhost:8080 and logging in with your newly created admin user.</p><p>Miniflux is a pleasure to use, and it&rsquo;s very easy to get acquainted with it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also possible to add custom CSS in its Settings.
