beginners because its interface is quite familiar thanks to the wide range of
available keys. It is branded as a gaming keyboard but frankly it was a fine

Red</a><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s a full wired keyboard with Cherry MX Red switches
(linear) and dedicated multimedia keys. In my opinion it is a solid choice for
beginners because its interface is quite familiar thanks to the wide range of
available keys. It is branded as a gaming keyboard but frankly it was a fine
office keyboard as well. However after using it for a while I wanted to
upgrade.</p><p>The natural upgrade path would contain one or more of the following features, in order of importance:</p><ol><li>good support for both <strong>Linux</strong> and macOS, especially Linux</li><li><strong>compact</strong>: tenkeyless a.k.a. 80%, or 75%<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></li><li><strong>portable</strong>: wireless, either with a dongle or with bluetooth or both</li><li>with decent battery life: should outlast at least a week of office work</li><li>not overpriced: ~$200 CAD budget</li><li>playful: with RGB backlight (instead of white LED)</li></ol><p>Given those, a natural upgrade path would have been the <a href=https://www.logitechg.com/en-ca/products/gaming-keyboards/g915-tkl-wireless.html>Logitech G915
TKL</a>. Its main caveat is that it is relatively overpriced,
~$300 CAD. Above that $300 CAD point one should arguably be looking for
ergonomic and/or fully programmable (QMK firmware) keyboards, like the Kinesis
Advantage and/or the Ergodox EZ<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. Even though the G915 TKL is rock solid, it
didn&rsquo;t have any fancy features to justify that investment.</p><h2 id=the-quest-for-the-_perfect_-keyboard>The quest for the <em>perfect</em> keyboard&mldr;</h2><p>I then proceeded to outsource my luck to the wisdom of the crowds, by asking
for recommendations in a mailing list at $DAYJOB, giving them a subset of the
requirements above.</p><p>The choice was then obvious: I&rsquo;d get a <strong>Keychron</strong>. It fit all of my
requirements perfectly. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice>issue</a> was that Keychron had
<a href=https://www.keychron.com/collections/all-products>so many choices</a> to pick from.</p><figure><a href=https://xkcd.com/1741/><img src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/work.png alt="Despite it being imaginary, I already have SUCH a strong opinion on the cord-switch firing incident."></a><figcaption><p>XKCD Courtesy of Randall Munroe</p></figcaption></figure><p>After some deliberation I had two options in mind: <a href=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard>Keychron K2</a>
and <a href=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-keyboard>Keychron K1</a> TKL. The main difference between them is that
the K1 is a low-profile keyboard. I didn&rsquo;t know what low-profile meant at the
time and had to do some research to figure it out<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>.</p><p>In the end I opted for the <a href=https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard><strong>Keychron K2</strong></a>, red switches (linear),
with RGB backlight.</p><h2 id=the-keyboard>The keyboard</h2><p>The keyboard met all my expectations, even surpassing them, I am quite satisfied overall:</p><dl><dt>Linux support</dt><dd>Great out-of-the-box support, it just works. Even though I <a href=https://perrotta.dev/2021/12/keychron-k2-linux-setup/>tweaked</a> a few configs, it wasn&rsquo;t strictly
necessary. In particular, there&rsquo;s a physical toggle where you can choose between
macOS (=Linux) or Windows mode. Furthermore they provide both macOS-style (command, option, etc) and
Windows-style keycaps (super, alt, etc). For Linux I tend to stick with the Windows ones.</dd><dt>Compact</dt><dd>A 75% keyboard is compact by definition, what else could I add?
I wouldn&rsquo;t go lower than that though, in my opinion removing the function keys
goes too far and makes the keyboard harder to use. A Tenkeyless / 80% option
would also be compact enough while maybe increasing comfort a little bit, but
I managed to adapt quickly to the 75% layout. Multimedia and OS keys are easily
available by the means of <code>Fn + F1</code>, etc.</dd><dt>Portable</dt><dd>It has bluetooth, but can also be used while plugged in. There&rsquo;s a toggle that
controls which mode (wireless or wired) to use. The bluetooth has 3 channels and
it&rsquo;s very easy to switch between them: <code>Fn + 1</code>, <code>Fn + 2</code>, <code>Fn + 3</code>. This makes it easy
to switch between laptops and/or workstation, work and/or personal. The cable connector
is USB-C which in my opinion is a must these days (2020s).</dd><dt>Battery life</dt><dd>Battery lasts more than enough, to the point that I don&rsquo;t even need to care about it.
I tend to recharge it every 2 weeks or so. <code>Fn + b</code> will let me have a visual indication
of how much juice is still left. The keyboard automatically sleeps after 10 minutes of inactivity
in order to save battery, which I think is a nice bonus, I don&rsquo;t need to worry about turning it off.
This can be disabled if it ends up being annoying, though.</dd><dt>Great value for money</dt><dd>$90 USD at the time of this writing. Because I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with international shipping, I ended up
simply buying it from one of their official local retailers in Canada, <a href=https://oneofzero.net/>OneOfZero</a>. This
slightly increased what I paid for it (~$150 CAD with taxes), on the other hand the shipping was really fast. Just
beware, this particular retailer does not have a friendly return policy, if I recall correctly they charge a 25% fee
and end up throwing the keyboard away (landfill), which is very depressing.</dd><dt>Playful</dt><dd>The RGB lighting is fluff and completely irrelevant in terms of productivity, however it adds a playful touch to the keyboard.
I would say that white lighting is enough, but sometimes it&rsquo;s just <em>cool</em> to change to different color(s).
What can I say, we humans are visual creatures. You can easily adjust the light brightness and toggle it on/off (<code>Fn + light</code>),
plus there are several patterns to choose from. I tend to use a still pattern because it isn&rsquo;t distracting for programming or
other type of work that requires focus.</dd></dl><p><strong>Finally</strong>: The keyboard keycaps are quite sturdy and stick well in place. I had some
issues with my previous keyboard where some of its keycaps would easily fall
off it when moving it within my backpack. I do not have this issue with the
Keychron.</p><h2 id=future>Future</h2><p>Mechanical keyboards are meant to last. I do not intend to upgrade it any time
soon. However, if/when I ever do it, I will be looking for the following features:</p><ul><li>QMK firmware / programmable: would unlock more workflow possibilities. The
Keychron Q1 would be a good candidate for this.</li><li>With a dongle, in addition to bluetooth. Because sometimes bluetooth is just
annoying and/or unreliable. The Logitech G915 TKL has a dongle.</li><li>Other switches? So far I&rsquo;ve only used red ones (linear). More silent switches
could be useful.</li><li>Ergonomic: Whether it&rsquo;s a split, an ortholinear or just a curved keyboard,
I figure that at some point it will be a good investment for my wrists.
Adaptation is difficult but it may be necessary one day.</li></ul><p>I am not particularly attracted to custom keycaps, they are cute but not my cup
of tea. And I also do not see the appeal of hot swappable keycaps. I can
understand why some folks appreciate those features, customizability is
powerful, but for me it&rsquo;s less stressful to keep things simple.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Linked to the <code>.pdf</code> because apparently the SKU isn&rsquo;t listed in the Logitech product website anymore.
