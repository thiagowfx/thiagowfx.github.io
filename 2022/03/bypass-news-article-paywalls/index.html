High-quality content deserves to be supported. The fragmentation isn&rsquo;t always
great and it&rsquo;s often hard to keep track of multiple distinct news sources and
portals / subscriptions, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day.</p><p>Sometimes people will link to news articles or websites with paywalls from
various sources (blogs, social media, other news articles, etc). I&rsquo;d rather
know in advance that those articles are paywalled, but that&rsquo;s not always
possible. After clicking them, curiosity already killed the cat.</p><p>There are several ways to access those as one-offs. I will add a disclaimer
that I do not publicly endorse any of those methods, they are just mentioned
for educational purposes.</p><p>The most typical way is to open an incognito tab or window in your browser with
the desired URL. This works because many paywalls are often implemented with
browser cookies.</p><p>The second most typical way is to use a VPN to appear that you&rsquo;re accessing the
URL from another IP address. This works for websites that add rolling article
limits per IP address.</p><p>Occasionally some large news websites will implement paywalls poorly:</p><blockquote><p>The idea is pretty simple, news sites want Google to index their content so
it shows up in search results. So they don&rsquo;t show a paywall to the Google
crawler. We benefit from this because the Google crawler will cache a copy of
the site every time it crawls it.</p><p>All we do is show you that cached, unpaywalled version of the page.</p></blockquote><p><a href=https://12ft.io/>12ft</a> automatically uses this mechanism to display cached
versions of news articles. If you&rsquo;re in <code>&lt;url></code>, just prepend <code>12ft.io</code> to it:
<code>https://12ft.io/&lt;url></code>.</p><p>Alternatively, <a href=https://outline.com/>Outline</a> used to be another
website/service to do so, but apparently it is
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30564665">unavailable</a> since last week.
Outline displays a <em>pretty printed</em> version of text from an article, looking a
lot like a markdown-rendered version of a web page.</p><p>Someone on Hacker News suggested <a href=https://txtify.it/>txtify.it</a> as a
replacement to it. Indeed, Txtify is very similar to Outline, however it
displays plain text instead (i.e. no formatting at all).</p><p>Apparently some people even go further by installing <a href=https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome>browser
extensions</a> to do so.</p><p>Ultimately, whenever possible, prefer to access news sources from news portals
that aren&rsquo;t paywalled and/or that you are a subscriber of.</p></content><p><a href=https://perrotta.dev/tags/privacy/>#privacy</a></p></main><footer><span>Copyright © 2021 - 2025 Thiago Perrotta · <a href=/index.xml>RSS</a> · a fork of <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ bear</a></span></footer></body></html>
