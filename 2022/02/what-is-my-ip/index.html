https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+my+ip. I suppose this is related to their
philosophy of not tracking their users.
This is the easiest method when you have a web browser as you do not need to
memorize any URL.

I love the simplicity of I can haz ip. It just returns your IP address in
plain text, nothing else. It also works from the web browser. You can find
details about it here. TL;DR: It was
an open source pet project of a single
person (Major Hayden), then it was eventually bought by
Cloudflare as it immensely grew."><meta name=keywords content="dev,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://perrotta.dev/2022/02/what-is-my-ip/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="not just serendipity"><meta property="og:title" content="What is my IP?"><meta property="og:description" content="This post contains a small handful of distinct services to query your machine external IP address.
