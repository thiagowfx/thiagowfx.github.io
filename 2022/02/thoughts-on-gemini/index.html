Gemini is a new internet protocol which:

Is heavier than gopher
Is lighter than the web
Will not replace either
Strives for maximum power to weight ratio
Takes user privacy very seriously


That&rsquo;s too abstract though. I prefer the way Kev Quirk puts it:

To put that into human-digestible form; Gemini is basically a very light, text-only alternative to HTML.

Gemini aims to replace &ldquo;lightweight HTML&rdquo;, but it already starts with a big barrier for entry and adoption: It&rsquo;s not obvious what it is by just reading its project homepage alone. This in my opinion comes off as elitist."><meta name=keywords content="selfhosted,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://perrotta.dev/2022/02/thoughts-on-gemini/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="not just serendipity"><meta property="og:title" content="Thoughts on Gemini"><meta property="og:description" content="From the homepage:

I prefer the way <a href=https://kevq.uk/gemini-isnt-the-solution-to-the-broken-web/>Kev Quirk</a> puts it:</p><blockquote><p>To put that into human-digestible form; Gemini is basically a very light, text-only alternative to HTML.</p></blockquote><p>Gemini aims to replace &ldquo;lightweight HTML&rdquo;, but it already starts with a big barrier for entry and adoption: It&rsquo;s not obvious what it is by just reading its project homepage alone. This in my opinion comes off as elitist.</p><p>Furthermore, you need a custom piece of software in order to consume the so-called gemini <em>capsules</em> (a fancy name for what&rsquo;s the equivalent of a plain-text <a href=https://jamstack.org/generators/>SSG</a> website).</p><p>I tried out <a href=https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora><code>amfora</code></a> which is a popular CLI one<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. Amfora is pretty decent and lightweight. The experience is very similar to a hybrid of using a CLI RSS reader like <a href=https://newsboat.org><code>newsboat</code></a> to keep track of your favorite capsules, and a CLI Web browser like <code>elinks</code> or <code>w3m</code> to navigate them.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s part of the adoption problem: Why would you subject yourself to purposely using a text-only browser in the 2020s? It is a painful experience, and there&rsquo;s not any extra value compared to just using a minimalist RSS reader like <a href=https://miniflux.app>miniflux</a> to keep track of your favorite blogs / news portals via RSS.</p><p>Nowadays there are plenty of SSGs, for every programming language you can think of, even in plain shell scripting (POSIX <code>sh</code>). There&rsquo;s little reason to learn a new niche protocol given that it&rsquo;s relatively easy to publish simple blogs.</p><p>Conclusion: As Kev puts it:</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you heard, but <a href=https://thewebisfucked.com>The Web Is F*cked</a> and techies everywhere are touting the Gemini protocol as its saviour. I disagree. A lot.</p></blockquote><p>I will end this article with a praise for Gemini, courtesy of <a href=https://drewdevault.com/2020/11/01/What-is-Gemini-anyway.html>Drew DeVault</a>. Drew argues that:</p><blockquote><p>My disdain for web browsers is well documented. Web browsers are extraordinarily complex, and any attempt to build a new one would be a Sisyphean task. Successfully completing that implementation, if even possible, would necessarily produce a Lovecraftian mess: unmaintainable, full of security vulnerabilities, with gigabytes in RAM use and hours in compile times. And given that all of the contemporary web browsers that implement a sufficiently useful subset of web standards are ass and getting assier, what should we do?</p></blockquote><p>Fine, but the beloved plain duo of HTML + CSS still works just fine. There&rsquo;s no need to create a new, difficult-to-use protocol to <em>force</em> people to keep things simple. Unless you just wanna have fun and treat it like a toy or learning project; then go for it. Nothing wrong with that.</p><p>My interest for Gemini ends as soon as this post is published.
