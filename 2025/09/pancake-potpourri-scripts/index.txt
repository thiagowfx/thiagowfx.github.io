I've been meaning to create a git repository to host a collection of
miscellaneous scripts / binaries that are too big to fit in shell aliases /
functions, or text snippets.

This started today: https://github.com/thiagowfx/pancake

There's no particular reason to call it "pancake", just like there's no special
reason to suffix my first name with "wfx". Sometimes it is just what it is.

I am still fleshing out a project structure, it shall become clearer as more
scripts are added over time.

For now:

```
% z pancake
thiago@MacBook-Pro ~/Workspace/pancake (git)-[master]
% tree
.
├── LICENSE
├── op_login_all
│   ├── op_login_all.sh
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
```
