Life is serene when you have a whiteboard at your disposal.

Having a channel to express yourself is a gift.

It alleviates tension knots in your nerves, making them softer and more relaxed.

All that is left for perfection is to pour in a few bits of creativity.

I love to have multiple whiteboard markers around, with different colors each.

There's a multitude of passion that simply cannot be properly expressed in a
monochromatic world.
