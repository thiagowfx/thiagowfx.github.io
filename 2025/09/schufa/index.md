[SCHUFA](http://schufa.de/) is a German credit score system.

Comparable to: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian in the U.S.

Prospective landlords often ask for a copy of your SCHUFA ("SCHUFA-Auskunft").

You can get a copy of your SCHUFA via
[meineschufa.de](https://www.meineschufa.de/#SCHUFA-Auskunft). It's not free: it
costs ~30€, but you can obtain it quickly and digitally.

That said, the GDPR ("DS-GVO") allows you to get a [free
copy](https://www.meineschufa.de/de/datenkopie) of your SCHUFA data, thanks to
its 15th article. It arrives by mail ("post") within 5 to 7 days. Input:

- full name
- birth date (DD.MM.YYYY) – Geburtsdatum
- current home address - aktuelle Anschrift
- email address

Alternatively, sign up for [bonify.de](https://www.bonify.de/), a _free_ online
service which allows you to monitor your SCHUFA online. It is updated every
quarter, and it's comparable to [CreditKarma](http://creditkarma.ca/).
