It is inevitable: at some point, bicycle brakes[^1] need maintenance. They start
to become greasy and squeaky, making a high pitch noise upon use.

**Upside**: Braking doubles-down as a natural bell. It is oddly satisfying,
somehow, to brake whilst making noise, thereby warning another fellow biker (or
a pedestrian!) of your approach.

[^1]: If I do not pay attention, I spell them as _breaks_.
