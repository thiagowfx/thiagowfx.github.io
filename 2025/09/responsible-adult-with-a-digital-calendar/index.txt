The experience of booking an online ticket (flight, train, concert, hotel, bnb,
event, you name it) feels too spammy today, involving half a dozen emails per
transaction.

A typical email wave goes like this:

- "Thank you for purchasing / attending / coming! Here's your ticket."
- Your Invoice
- Your payment confirmation (especially when using an external service such as PayPal)
- A few days before the event / trip: a reminder
- The day before (or the same day): another reminder
- If it's a flight ticket, expect even more emails: flight safety instructions
  (e.g. what you cannot bring in your luggage), "the check-in is now open!
  You can now choose your seat" (for a fee)

In addition, I often snooze the initial email to a day before the event takes
place, so that's another one.

I appreciate the reminders, but I do not need them. For me, they end up becoming
notification spam, resembling ads – I _do not_ want to keep your company in my
mind all the time.
