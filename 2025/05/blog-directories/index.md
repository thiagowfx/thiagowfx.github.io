Without social media algorithms, how can you discover new blogs to follow?

Enter [blog directories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_directory):

> There are two ways to find information on the Web: by searching or browsing.
> Web directories provide links in a structured list to make browsing easier.
> Many web directories combine searching and browsing by providing a search
> engine to search the directory. Unlike search engines, which base results on
> a database of entries gathered automatically by web crawler, most web
> directories are built manually by human editors. Many web directories allow
> site owners to submit their site for inclusion, and have editors review
> submissions for fitness.

A few directories I like[^1]:

- ✪ https://feedle.world/
- ✪ https://static.quest
- ✪ https://rss.social/
- ✪ https://250kb.club/ / https://256kb.club/
- ✪ https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/dashboard (an indieweb webring)
- https://ooh.directory/

I tend to visit them occasionally, whenever I crave for new content, perhaps like
[doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) in social media.

Most new blogs I subscribe to come from indirect referrals. I read a blog post I
like that links to another blog post, I visit it to find out more and realize
that it's interesting, then I subscribe to it.

More rarely there's also the direct referral way, for example, when I become
aware that a friend or a coworker has started a blog recently.

The combination of referrals + directories is quite sustainable.
