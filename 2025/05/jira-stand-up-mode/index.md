Worth:

> Jira recently launched 'Standup Mode' feature, and love it!
>
> When you click the "Start Standup" button on any Jira board, your board
> converts to a simplified, presentation version.
>
> On the left, each team member is listed in random order, which you can
> re-shuffle. I like to avoid the same order of reports every day, so this helps
> me.
>
> You can assign a timer for each member that restarts as you switch.

The default is 2 minutes. I like it.
