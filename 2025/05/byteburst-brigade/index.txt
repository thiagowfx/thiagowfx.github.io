If you have Telegram, you're welcome to join [ByteBurst
Brigade](https://t.me/+OzLfJRhjA69iNWFh), a supergroup I host with friends to
discuss Tech in general: privacy, self-hosting, news, workflows, etc.

The noise in the group is low – arguably, that's a feature, à la
[lobsters](https://lobste.rs/about#invitations).
