Find your [Next Read](https://nextread.info/):

> Easily discover your next read by using your GoodReads data
>
> Simply upload your CSV file and explore your long list off want-to-reads. Set
> a minimum age to ensure your next read has survived the hype
>
> Use more parameters than those available in GoodReads. Combine multiple filters and sorting options at the same time to find a book that suits you.

As someone with more than 700 books marked as "to read" on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), I appreciate this little tool.

All you need to do is export your goodreads CSV data (with one click!) and then
import it on Next Read.

The provided filtering options are quite handy.

Note that this is a disposable tool – you're supposed to save your (s)elected
next reads elsewhere (I do it in my current PKM of choice,
[LogSeq](https://logseq.com/)). Account state is not persisted.
