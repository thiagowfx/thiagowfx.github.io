I just added [Openring](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring) to my
[blogroll](/blogroll/) page:

> This is a tool for generating a webring from RSS feeds, so you can link to
> other blogs you like on your own blog. It's designed to be fairly simple and
> integrate with any static site generator. [...]

Granted, this is a static website.

As such, `openring` displays 3 random recent articles from blogs in my blogroll
each time the site is deployed.
