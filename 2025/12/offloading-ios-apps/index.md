Going on vacation?

Have an iPhone?

There's no need to delete Slack, or your ~~favorite~~ on-call app.

Simply [offload](https://support.apple.com/en-al/guide/iphone/iph47c931112/ios)
noisy apps.

Why is this better than uninstalling them?

Because it's much easier to restore them once you are back. You do so with a
single tap in each app.

Of course, this method is only effective if you don't have the urge to tap your
offloaded apps. Some people have more self-control than others.
