Humans are terrible at remembering complex command lines.

This issue compounds whenever there is a myriad of commands to remember.

I've been thinking for ages on how to address this gap efficiently. I finally
got a decent workflow.

* Unlimited + synchronized shell history: [`atuin`]({{< ref
  "2025-11-30-atuin" >}}).
* Text expander: [`espanso`]({{< ref "2025-05-16-espanso-hello-world" >}}).

And now, the missing piece: a snippets manager.

There are three good options:

* [MassCode](https://masscode.io/)
* [Snippets Lab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/)
* [`pet`](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet): command-line

I am piloting Snippets Lab[^1]. It has integration with
[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/renfei_song/snippetslab), and also a system
tray icon.

These three solutions are enough to manage anything I may ever want to recall.
Commands at my fingertips.

We can finish with the cherry on top: [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/) entries to
archive deprecated or _potentially_ useful commands.

From 2026 onwards, no command shall ever be lost.

**Note**: The aforementioned programs are intended for macOS. Atuin, Espanso,
MassCode, `pet` and LogSeq are cross-platform. Snippets Lab is macOS only.

[^1]: It is very comparable to MassCode. This choice was a bit arbitrary.
