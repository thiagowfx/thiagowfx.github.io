KOReader does not come with many installed dictionaries out-of-the-box, but it's
possible to download a few extras. The default ones leave a lot to be desired.

Follow these steps:

- Connect your Kindle to Wi-Fi
- Open KOReader in your Kindle
- Click the magnifying glass at the top menu
- Settings > Dictionary settings > Download dictionaries

There is a vast selection (to the point of being overwhelming!) of dictionaries
available for download, including translations (e.g. English-Portuguese). When
in doubt, choose Wiktionary files.
