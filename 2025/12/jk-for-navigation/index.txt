I just added vim-style keybindings to this site.

Press **j** to go to the previous post (chronologically, going down the list ⬇️)
and **k** to go to the next post (going up the list ⬆️)[^1].

The boundary between _general_ vs _coding_ posts is respected.

[^1]: I also added arrow keys (⬅️ for the previous post and ➡️ right for the next
    one).
