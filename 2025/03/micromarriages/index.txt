That's serendipity, in its simplest and purest form.

Perhaps I should coin the term _microserendipity_ to denote "bits of
serendipity" according to a given event.

Some food for thought.

Meanwhile, a friend recently introduced me to the concept of [meet
cute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_cute):
