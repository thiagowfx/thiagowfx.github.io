> ## TeX and Metafont
>
> ### by Donald Knuth
>
> In his seminal text layout system, TeX, and his equally
brilliant typeface design system, METAFONT, Donald uses a versioning number
system that asymptotically approaches perfection. The version numbers of TeX
approach π (the current version is `3.14159265`) and the version numbers of
METAFONT approach `e`. It has been prophesied that the last change not be made
until after the day Donald ascends to heaven on a shining cloud. At that point,
Donald will make one last ssh connection down from heaven to his server at
Stanford University and set the version number unto π _exactly_. At that point
all remaining bugs will be declared features, and the output from TeX will
remain the same for all eternity.
