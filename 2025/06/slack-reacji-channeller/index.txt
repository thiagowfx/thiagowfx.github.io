Consider an organization that uses [Slack](https://slack.com/).

There are many channels. There is chatter, everywhere, all the time. There is
noise. It's hard to find a given thread after two or three days, lost in the sea
of scrollback message threads.

**Problem statement**: How to cherry-pick certain messages, intended for a
periodic review meeting?

For example, maybe you want to collect all issues your fellow coworkers
complained about in your support channel, to file bugs/tickets about them.

Or perhaps you want to collect all on-call and outage issues experienced during
the week.

Or even gather future product roadmap ideas in a board somewhere.

It is super tedious to copy and paste messages one by one. Also, to do so incurs
a non-trivial cost in terms of context switching.

Enter [Reacji
Channeler](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360000482666-Reacji-Channeller-for-Slack):

> With the Reacji Channeller app, you can instantly copy a message from one
> public channel to another using specific reaction emoji, or 'reacji'. This
> comes in handy when something posted to a channel could be useful to
> conversations happening elsewhere across your workspace.

It is one of these simple-but-effective clever ideas, it almost feels like
cheating.

> **The benefits** 👍
>
> - Move a message automatically from one public channel to another.
> - Redirect ideas and feedback or organise stray requests into relevant channels.
> - Increase a message's visibility by copying it to a channel with more members

For example, you can map/assign the ⭐️ (star) emoji to automatically relay
messages to the `#idea` channel. Or 🐛 (insect) to `#bugs`.

And then it becomes much easier to process all these messages at once, for
upcoming review meetings. The less context switching, the better!
