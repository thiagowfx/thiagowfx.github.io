It's a [new year](https://getfullyear.com/). Time for a new wallpaper!

I like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/t/wallpapers).

They also have an [iOS app](https://unsplash.com/apps/ios).

I used to keep my current wallpaper in cloud storage, symlinked from
`~/.wallpaper` so to integrate well with my
[.dotfiles](https://github.com/thiagowfx/.dotfiles), however I no longer do so.
