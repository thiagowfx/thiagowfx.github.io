It is well-known that, given `larry@gmail.com`, you can use the Gmail "plus
addressing" (+) feature with `larry+{alias}@gmail.com` to receive emails in the
former.

But what if you need to _send_ emails from `larry+{alias}@gmail.com`?

This turns out to be [possible](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/3598/is-there-any-way-to-send-an-email-from-a-gmail-plus-address).

Add your plus email the same way you'd add any other email to [send
from](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370).

**Use case**: customer support. Some systems will allow replies from _only_ the
email address originally used to file a support ticket.
