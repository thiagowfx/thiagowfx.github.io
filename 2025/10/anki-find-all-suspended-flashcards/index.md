The following queries are useful to find flashcards (notes or cards) in
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) that you're struggling with.

- `is:suspended`
- `tag:leech`

The action item for each should be one of the following:

- do nothing for now
- delete the note / card if it's no longer relevant e.g. perhaps it is barely
  used
- enhance or rewrite the note / card for better retention and then unsuspend it

It's a slow process.
