Whenever I am submitting forms in the Web, I have the habit (tendency?) to keep
hitting `Cmd-A Cmd-C` every once in a while, with the goal of saving all the
text I've typed so far in a given text input field to the system clipboard.

This practice, when paired with a clipboard manager, acts as a backup mechanism.

This habit grew out of frustration: many times have I been frustrated because
web pages would suddenly crash or reload, and everything I had typed thus far
would have been lost.

Not any longer.
