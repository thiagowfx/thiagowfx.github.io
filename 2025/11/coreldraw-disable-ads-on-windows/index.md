From 'Technical Support' tales of the trenches.

Whenever CorelDRAW is installed on Windows, by default it will display ads upon
startup, every single day. I call this malware.

To disable this hostile behavior:

- Open Task Scheduler ('Agendador de Tarefas')
- Look at the task library ('biblioteca do agendador de tarefas')
- Deactivate or delete the entries named `CorelUpdateHelperTaskCore*`

Enjoy peace.
