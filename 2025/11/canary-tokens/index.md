[Canary Tokens](https://canarytokens.org/),
[introduction](https://docs.canarytokens.org/guide/):

> What are Canarytokens
>
> Canarytokens are like motion sensors for your networks, computers and clouds.
> You can put them in folders, on network devices and on your phones.
>
> Place them where nobody should be poking around and get a clear alarm if they
> are accessed. They are designed to look juicy to attackers to increase the
> likelihood that they are opened (and they are completely free).

They are like [honeypots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)).

They are like a digital version of [Air Tags](https://www.apple.com/airtag/):

> Our Canarytokens are easy to sprinkle all over and forget about, until you get
> the notification that matters. They are super lightweight and don't require
> installing software or running more background processes that can slow down
> your PC.

I especially like the idea of the [Credit Card
Token](https://canarytokens.org/nest/).

> We give you unique Credit Card details
>
> You place it somewhere.
>
> We send you an alert when that Credit Card is used.
>
> Ideas for using the Credit Card token:
>
> You can use any name or address in association with the card number and CVV
>
> Stick this in a database that stores payment information and get alerted if it
> is ever breached.
>
> Put it in a document with other personal information regarding e.g., travel
> preferences in case someone snoops around your computer

There are various other canary tokens that are super useful.

It's like [adding tripping wires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S03VAuxH7lM)
all over the place.
