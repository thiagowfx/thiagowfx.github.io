For a long time I wanted to write a blog post about `stow`.

My procrastination has paid off: [pbrisbin](https://pbrisbin.com/posts/stow/)
has written one first.

I am also a former user of
[rcm](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos). I share
the same considerations as the author.

I am quite happy with `stow` as a dotfiles manager. Every once in a while I
attempt to integrate Ansible to manage the rest of my dotfiles setup, but it
never sticks. Simplicity always wins in the test of time.
