Hello world.

This blog post is being dictated by [Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/).

I'm not writing any text at all. Every word that is coming out was dictated one
by one. Frankly I have no idea whether this works effectively or not, but
apparently Superwhisper seems to be a good way to make it faster to type in
words with your mouth and with your voice instead of using your hands.

The main use case seems to be intended for LLMs. We are getting so lazy to write
code that now we are even getting lazy to prompt LLMs to write code for us.

We can do everything by just talking with our mouth. And now I'm going one step
beyond and using this application to write blog posts for me.

I have no idea whether this will stick but I find it interesting to use this
application to automate some typing. At the very least it would be helpful to
alleviate some RSI on our hands.

Well, this was a hello word post, bye bye.

And I should also add, this is using the parakeet model from Nvidia. Everything
is being processed locally on my MacBook. Nothing is being sent to the cloud. I
think this is important these days.

## Colophon

The previous sentences were manually formatted by this human, plus manual
corrections and links were added.

The raw version came very close. **IMPRESSIVE** stuff, goodness:
