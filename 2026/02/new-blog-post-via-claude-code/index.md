It's 2026. Blogging to my static website from a laptop, with vim and markdown, with hugo build and git commit / git push is old-school.

I can instead create blog posts via the [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) app. It already has access to my git repository. It knows how to clone it, commit to it, test it (when needed) and push it to GitHub.

If you can read this, it means this experiment worked flawlessly.

And, you see, everything is still my own text, my own words. The LLM is not writing the prose. It's merely orchestrating the act of publishing it.

Will this lower my barrier to blogging more often?
