After reading the book [Highest Duty: My Search for What Really
Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6404803-highest-duty) by Chesley
"Sully" B. Sullenberger III, to which I gave **5 stars**:

> Now a major motion picture from Clint Eastwood, starring Tom Hanks — the
> inspirational autobiography by one of the most captivating American heroes of
> our time, Capt. 'Sully' Sullenberger — the pilot who miraculously landed a
> crippled US Airways Flight 1549 in New York's Hudson River, saving the lives
> of all 155 passengers and crew.

...I finally had the opportunity to listen to the cockpit

flight ordeal.

Goodness, I have no words to describe how amazing and miraculous everything was!
It feels shocking and unlikely, because it is. And yet, after reading the book,
after learning about Capt. Sully's upbringing, perspective / viewpoint,
experience and, most importantly, his skill set and aptitude, it's simply
magical: everything makes sense, all pieces just fit, wisdom flows.

I find this story deeply inspiring.

There's a [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3263904/) (2016) about it as
well, starring Tom Hanks. I am looking forward to watching it.
I find that watching a movie is way more enjoyable after reading its
corresponding book.

Here is [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6EblErBJqw) with Captain
Sully.
