I own a smart speaker for many years now. It happens to be a Google Home[^1].

Top three usage patterns:

- hey google, what's the weather?
- hey google, wake me up at 8am
- hey google, set a 30-minute timer (for the kitchen, or for the laundry)

Any other speaker in the market (e.g. Amazon Echo with Alexa) can accomplish the
same functionality.

In fact, even my phone can do all these (weather app, clock app).

Google Home has no moat, but it works reliably well.

What is the point of owning a smart speaker? Purely convenience.

Occasional usage patterns include:

- hey google, play {artist} or {song} (on Spotify)
- hey google, living room lights off (except that I no longer own smart lights)
- hey google, set the temperature to 21 (Celsius) (except that I no longer own a
  smart thermostat)

A few years ago these smart speakers were all the rage. Suddenly they all got
completely forgotten.

[^1]: Or is it a Google Nest? Or a Google Nest Home? Or a Google Home Mini? I am
    lost.
