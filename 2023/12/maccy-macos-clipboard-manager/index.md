**Strongly recommended** to all software developers who use macOS: [Maccy](https://maccy.app/).

> Clipboard manager for macOS which does one job — keep your copy history at hand. Period.
>
> Lightweight. Open source. No fluff.

**Shortcut**: `Cmd + Shift + C` to open a clipboard menu with all your recently
copied items, plus a search bar for quick grepping.

Hands down this is the best piece of software I added to my workflow in 2023,
competing with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and
[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) in terms of productivity.
