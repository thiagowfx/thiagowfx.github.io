Hi there. This will probably become a new mini series. I begin by quoting
Vanessa Da Mata:

> É só isso
> Não tem mais jeito
> Acabou, boa sorte
> Não tenho o que dizer
> São só palavras
> E o que eu sinto
> Não mudará
> Tudo o que quer me dar
> É demais
> É pesado
> Não há paz
> Tudo o que quer de mim
> Irreais
> Expectativas
> Desleais
>
> That's it
> There's no way
> It's over, good luck
> I've nothing left to say
> It's only words
> And what I feel
> Won't change
>
> [...]
>
> Tudo o que quer me dar / Everything you want to give me
> É demais / It's too much
> É pesado / It's heavy
> Não há paz / There's no peace

Upstream URL with lyrics. Now, a little bit of context. Two or three weeks ago I
began learning **vim**. This is due to a lot of reasons: one of them is that vim
is actively used by a lot of members of the **Arch Linux community**, and I
usually am influenced about their tastes — what doesn't mean that I will comply
with everything, it is just a matter of trying new things.

Another reason is that I am actively learning new **open source tools**, and vim
is definitely one of the most widespread and **ubiquitous** ones. I don't need to
provide statistical sources for that, do you agree? **Vi** is present everywhere,
even on my Android. (Now, almost nobody uses vi anymore, however vi and vim are
too much similar that for simple and rapid tasks usually annoying differences
won't even be noticed).

Another reason is that I never became 100% satisfied with **Emacs**. Hey, I like
emacs very much, don't get me wrong, however there were always some piece of
completeness missing in it, so this puzzle never got finished. In particular,
orgmode (an emacs task-manager-note-taker-and-everything mode) is a tool that I
felt in loved with, and thanks to it I won't completely remove emacs from my
system; you should notice that orgmode is something very specific to emacs.

Although there are some tentatives on vim implementations, as far as I read, they
are not very good (at least not compared to a vanilla, emacs orgmode). Okay,
those are sufficient for now, but there are more reasons that will reveal
themselves along the next posts.

Now, we should go back to the lyrics. I really love how this music is related to
emacs; in particular:

> Tudo o que quer me dar / Everything you want to give me
> É demais / It's too much
> É pesado / It's heavy
> Não há paz / There's no peace

That's is right. Emacs always was regarded to as the dinosaur, as the operating
system of your computer, as the I-want-to-rule-all-your-workstation program.
This has both its advantages and disadvantages, of course. The point with vim is
that is tries to Keep it Simple. It will **never** be everything: it is only
your text editor. Nothing more.

Well, although people will always try to write a Twitter Client for it and
similar things, I feel it is not natural. No, **IT IS NOT**!! Now, with emacs,
those things are pretty natural. It was created to be extended! (Emacs is
described as the extensible text editor.)

Along the last two years, I've tested more than a hundred of add-ons and
customizable pieces and bits for it: it is so cool how a functional language
(**Emacs Lisp**) can improve a text editor. 2048 game, flappymacs, twitter
client, mediawiki client, xkcd browser, RSS reader, calendar application
(built-in), calculator (built-in), mail client … Yeah, emacs is everything!
Maybe **too much** for me.

Now, this is the part that makes me feel a little sad: **_There's no peace_**.
Yeah, this is a problem. If you browse through my dotfiles repository on Github,
more specifically, through its commit history, you'll see that my `_.emacs_` file
is one of the files that **most** changed through the days. I am always editing
something of it, and I am never completely 100% satisfied with the outcome.

Because it is to easy to **tweak** and **customize** **almost every aspect** of
Emacs, this means it is also possible to customize some aspects that I should
probably not even be bothering to (and I should probably not touch those ones).
Now, this proved to be a problem...

Whoa. I hope you might like this mini series and want to see some (or all!) of
the above topics discussed. During it (please notice this comment won't be
repeated further on), feel free to leave out any comments about your specific
experiences about vim or emacs. Also, you are encouraged to suggest me
additional topics about my experience with emacs (and my soon-to-be-born
experience with vim too), and even choose one of the above topics to I write
about next. Until the next post! (For now, read this.) **Update**: [next post]({{< ref "2014-10-05-from-emacs-to-vim-chapter-1-vim-plug-ins" >}} "From Emacs to Vim – Chapter #1 – Vim plug-ins").
