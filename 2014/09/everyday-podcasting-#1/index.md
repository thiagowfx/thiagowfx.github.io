I'm a huge fan of podcasts. In this post I'll be talking a little about how I
got to know them.

I still remember when I first listened to a podcast. I had a Nokia E63 (Symbian
3rd Edition) smartphone, with its ~250MB of RAM and its QWERTY keyboard. Oh, it
was so nice. I owned it for more than 2 years, until it got stolen. It was
really cool to try to find `.sys` and `.sysx` apps for it, because the Ovi Store
was such a crappy thing. It had an integrated podcast manager (podcatcher).

I always tried to explore almost all of the options from my devices, so I got
curious about it and searched for a few podcasts. I was a soon-to-be linux
fanboy, so I used the 'linux' keyword and expected to find something. This is
the first podcast I've ever listened to. Period. Oh, I couldn't understand much
of it—only a few words. My English listening wasn't very good in those old days
(~September/October 2012). I still watched some TV series with English subtitles
at the time (nowadays I don't). However, I still listened to it. I really
enjoyed those three guys talking (Mark, Seth and Chris). And I still enjoy
it—serendipity proves that searching for linux wasn't a bad idea at all.

This podcast isn't really about Linux. It's more like "life in the context of
linux": the three friends (four, I include myself too!) talk about their
everyday lives, happenings in their country, **bacon** hahahaha—and pretty much
everything. It's a nice way to get informed about the culture of the United
States and to get updated about the adventures of the three friends (there are
so many things they talk about, from their old devices to their family).

The first episode I referred to was episode #66. Now, there are about 160
episodes. I've listened to almost all of them—probably skipped one or another,
but it's definitely more than 250 hours with those guys. Pretty nice, huh? I'll
continue this new series later, with concise tips about podcasts, and tell you
about other podcasts that I enjoy.
