**Warning:** the gap between this idea and the writing of this post is really
really short, so sit back and wait for chaos.

Months ago I participated of what I called 'my openbox challenge', where I wrote
six posts about my experience with the openbox window manager. On that times, I
wanted to use a simple window manager, not a full-featured, bloated desktop
environment, so I toke this opportunity to share some knowledge I would learn
through the way and, ya know, get used to it. Today I am happily to announce I
am satisfied with the i3 window manager. It is currently the default for my Arch
Linux Desktop, and I don't care about the others. Sadly I didn't do a challenge
about i3, because I was busy while I was trying it. Also, in this epoch I began
to write here some posts in English. I said this would be a way to practice my
own English -- and yeah, it really is. It's harder (= takes more time) for me if
I'm not writing on my native language. But okay, probably it is a good idea to
let my gramatical errors lay down here...

Anyway, back on topic, from now on I will be a _web-oriented_ person. Let me
clarify: last years I spent much of my free time learning about Linux and, more
recently, Emacs. Both of these topic subjects were a good choice (for me), and I
don't regret spending my time on these activities. But, for now, I will pay most
of my attention (on free time, _dammit_) to web activities. This means I'll
start learning from servers, databases (administration and modeling) and
backend, until javascript and frontend. Oh, this path is long, _really really_
long, but I'll put my faith on it, because I believe the web will be the future
(it already is).

It wouldn't make sense to start a challenge like this NOW. It does takes time.
So I'm just announcing I'll be doing something new about Web on the next couple
of months. Actually, I began today, but I'll pause for a while because college
tests are coming.
