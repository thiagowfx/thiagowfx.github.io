<p>It works exactly as advertised:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email to someone whose address book contains your email address, and it will <em>not</em> go to spam.</li>
<li>Send an email to someone whose address book does <em>not</em> contain your email address, and it goes straight to the spam folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The email body is indeed invisible, at least in the Gmail web UI. Even <code>Ctrl+A</code> won&rsquo;t reveal it. If you click &ldquo;Show original&rdquo; to inspect the full message body and headers though, you&rsquo;ll see some junk like the following:</p>

<p>The aforementioned text is wrapped in this HTML:</p>

deserves my attention, I will throw in a monthly subscription for it.
High-quality content deserves to be supported. The fragmentation isn&rsquo;t always
great and it&rsquo;s often hard to keep track of multiple distinct news sources and
portals / subscriptions, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will link to news articles or websites with paywalls from
various sources (blogs, social media, other news articles, etc). I&rsquo;d rather
know in advance that those articles are paywalled, but that&rsquo;s not always
possible. After clicking them, curiosity already killed the cat.</p>
<p>There are several ways to access those as one-offs. I will add a disclaimer
that I do not publicly endorse any of those methods, they are just mentioned
for educational purposes.</p>
<p>The most typical way is to open an incognito tab or window in your browser with
the desired URL. This works because many paywalls are often implemented with
browser cookies.</p>
<p>The second most typical way is to use a VPN to appear that you&rsquo;re accessing the
URL from another IP address. This works for websites that add rolling article
limits per IP address.</p>
<p>Occasionally some large news websites will implement paywalls poorly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is pretty simple, news sites want Google to index their content so
it shows up in search results. So they don&rsquo;t show a paywall to the Google
crawler. We benefit from this because the Google crawler will cache a copy of
the site every time it crawls it.</p>
<p>All we do is show you that cached, unpaywalled version of the page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://12ft.io/">12ft</a> automatically uses this mechanism to display cached
versions of news articles. If you&rsquo;re in <code>&lt;url&gt;</code>, just prepend <code>12ft.io</code> to it:
<code>https://12ft.io/&lt;url&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://outline.com/">Outline</a> used to be another
website/service to do so, but apparently it is
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30564665">unavailable</a> since last week.
Outline displays a <em>pretty printed</em> version of text from an article, looking a
lot like a markdown-rendered version of a web page.</p>
<p>Someone on Hacker News suggested <a href="https://txtify.it/">txtify.it</a> as a
replacement to it. Indeed, Txtify is very similar to Outline, however it
displays plain text instead (i.e. no formatting at all).</p>
<p>Apparently some people even go further by installing <a href="https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome">browser
extensions</a> to do so.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whenever possible, prefer to access news sources from news portals
that aren&rsquo;t paywalled and/or that you are a subscriber of.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google and Duckduckgo</title><link>https://thiagowfx.github.io/2022/02/google-and-duckduckgo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 18:51:00 -0500</pubDate><author>tbperrotta@gmail.com (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://thiagowfx.github.io/2022/02/google-and-duckduckgo/</guid><description>&lt;p>My search engine of choice is &lt;a href="https://google.com/">Google&lt;/a>, nonetheless I still enjoy &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo&lt;/a> occasionally.&lt;/p>

<p>The main reason to stick with Google is its superior quality, by the means of better search results. 20 years later, it&rsquo;s still arguably the best search engine. Of course, part of the reason for that is contingent upon how much data it collects, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day&hellip;</p>
<p>There are at least three reasons to use DuckDuckGo as an <em>alternative</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s privacy-focused, there&rsquo;s no tracking and no bubbling<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>its search results stem from sources other than Google; these days, mostly from Bing</li>
<li>it has <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang"><strong>!bangs</strong></a>, lots of them</li>
</ul>
<p>The quest(ion) then becomes: How can I use mostly Google, but still have quick access to DuckDuckGo bangs?</p>
<p>There are several ways to do so.</p>
<h2 id="duckduckgoog">DuckDuckGoog</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.duckduckgoog.com/">DuckDuckGoog</a> is a search engine which does exactly that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Searches Google and !bangs DuckDuckGo. Tell your browser!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If I search for <code>i3</code>, it will open <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=i3">https://www.google.com/search?q=i3</a> and probably think I am interested in Intel i3 CPUs.</li>
<li>If I search for <code>!aw i3</code>, using the ArchWiki bang, it opens <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3</a> and goes straight to the <code>i3</code> window manager page in the ArchWiki, exactly what I wanted.</li>
<li>If I search for <code>!ddg i3</code>, it opens <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=i3">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=i3</a>, on DuckDuckGo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Caveat: You cannot add custom search engines to Safari, therefore this method only works in other browsers (Firefox, Chrome, etc).</p>
<h3 id="self-hosted">Self-Hosted</h3>
<p>DuckDuckGoog <a href="https://www.duckduckgoog.com/privacy">claims</a> to collect no data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite simple. DuckDuckGoog doesn&rsquo;t track any queries submitted whatsoever, It simply redirects you to DuckDuckGo or Google depending on whether your search contains a !bang or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you still don&rsquo;t trust it for some reason, you could also self-host it in your own server, as it&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/mikecrittenden/duckduckgoog">open source</a>.</p>
<p>One advantage of doing so is using (and owning) your own infrastructure, which is probably more reliable in terms of bandwidth and latency than a random guy&rsquo;s server in the wild.</p>
<h2 id="bang-quick-search">!Bang Quick Search</h2>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bang-quick-search/kcopjlobikiakoacoadbnghpdcmngali">!Bang Quick Search</a> is a Chrome extension:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This extension adds DuckDuckGo !bang search to chrome. You can use it from the URL bar as long as your default search engine is either google or bing (for now). You can also use it directly on google&rsquo;s and bing&rsquo;s websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So long as your search engine is set to either Google or Bing, it will intercept <code>!bangs</code> from your query to redirect them to DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>Tip: Use <code>!ddg</code> to search on DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>Caveat: As a Chrome extension, it obviously only works in Chrome (or any of its derivatives like Edge or Vivaldi).</p>
<h2 id="duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo</h2>
<p>Another simple way is to just use DuckDuckGo directly. Whenever you want to go to Google, just add <code>!g</code> to your query.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>I used all three methods in the past. My favorite one these days is the Chrome Extension because Chrome is my current browser.</p>
<p>As a fallback I find that using DuckDuckGo directly is acceptable as well, however it quickly becomes quite annoying to constantly add <code>!g</code> to every query. Defaults matter.</p>
