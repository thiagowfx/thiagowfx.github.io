&lt;p>Exponential Idle is a math-inspired incremental game available on Android and iOS. Your goal is to stack up money by taking advantage of exponential growth. To do so, you have to step through time by tapping the equation or simply let the time follow its course. You can perform change of variables to accelerate the process, buy upgrades, get rewards, and unlock achievements while earning virtual money.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I wanted to be notified whenever a flight deal from Munich&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> appeared. The
destination doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I wanted to be notified whenever a flight deal from Munich<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> appeared. The
destination doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do so semi-automatically, I tried all of them at least
once:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow travel blogs</li>
<li>sign up for newsletters</li>
<li>follow instagram pages or influencers that relay promos</li>
<li>visit the websites from airlines directly</li>
<li>use bots / scraping</li>
<li>ask friends periodically</li>
<li>date a flight attendant</li>
</ul>
<p>The list above is overwhelming, and I have no time for all of it. Furthermore, I
have zero desire to inundate myself with (even) more social media posts, that
are often empty in nature.</p>
<p>Moreover I wanted to build a permanent and long-lasting solution on top of my
personal infrastructure.</p>
<p>Hence the only real options were: (i) travel blogs, (ii) newsletters, (iii)
scraping.</p>
<p>The first phase is implemented as a Telegram channel:
<a href="https://t.me/bavariabudgetbirds">https://t.me/bavariabudgetbirds</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever there are new deals my server pushes an update to the Telegram channel
above for each of them. The deals<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> are tracked via a list of curated RSS feed
subscriptions, which is filtered to only match keywords that are pertaining to
Munich. It is not perfect, but it is good enough for my purposes, virtually
marginally free to run, and needs zero maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>I have a VPS that runs <a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a>. The VPS
provider is not important.</p>
<p>The OS runs the excellent <a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> app, managed via
OpenRC. In this specific deployment, there is no <code>systemd</code>, and there is no
virtualization (<code>docker</code>, <code>kubernetes</code>, etc). It is 100%
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>. Miniflux is actively
developed and Alpine Linux package releases happen frequently and quickly. Even
if they do not, I have the means to create <code>APKBUILD</code>s myself when needed
(see previous posts).</p>
<p>Miniflux is populated with the list of travel blogs I follow, filtering out
non-relevant posts, polled roughly every 2 hours. There is a separate Miniflux
user for this purpose, so that my own subscriptions do not get mingled
in-between.</p>
<p>I use the Miniflux integration with Telegram to ensure that new posts are
immediately pushed to the aforementioned channel with my Telegram bot.</p>
<p>Wishlist for the future:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the ability to integrate with websites that do not support
RSS directly and/or that block RSS readers. Examples:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lowcost.pro/route/MUC/XXX/EN/">https://lowcost.pro/route/MUC/XXX/EN/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.secretflying.com/posts/category/cities-countries/germany/">https://www.secretflying.com/posts/category/cities-countries/germany/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.trabber.de/en/flights-from-germany-de/">https://www.trabber.de/en/flights-from-germany-de/</a></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Convert newsletters-only sources to RSS feeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>This solution can easily be generalized for any location; there is absolutely
nothing special about Munich in this context.</p>

them.</p>
<p>In this umpteenth iteration of my personal blog, I realized from the start that
I would be much happier by not having any anxiety related to trying to figure
out how many visitors I have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a peace of mind to write just for the sake of writing.</p>
<p>A public blog is not a journal, yet it plays its own role in the grand scheme of
things.</p>
<p>The world would be a happier place if we cared less about numbers; or, at least,
certain numbers, such as Instagram / Twitter / TikTok followers, or story views,
or blog post impressions.</p>
<p>The obvious and most sensible exception is when(ever) you have a business or a
brand. Then it is important to stay in the know, when your revenue depends on
it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Emoji appropriation</title><link>https://www.perrotta.dev/2024/07/emoji-appropriation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 22:39:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.perrotta.dev/2024/07/emoji-appropriation/</guid><description>Sometimes, when you chat with people, you notice that they tend to use a certain (sub)set of emojis frequently.
