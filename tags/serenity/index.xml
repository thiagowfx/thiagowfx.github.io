&lt;p>You can either patch (fix) the existing inner tube, or replace it with a new one
(&amp;lt;5€). In this post, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0F_hibWHlU">patching&lt;/a> is
out of scope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I keep forgetting the right technique to do so, hence here are a few notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whenever time is pressing or patience is low, just pay someone to do it for you.
In my experience, in Germany, the labor costs ~15-20€. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s
possible to do it at &lt;a href="https://www.decathlon.de/">Decathlon&lt;/a>, though typically
only during weekdays. With that said, it&amp;rsquo;s more economical (and satisfying!) to
do it yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sequence&lt;/strong>: (inner) tube -&amp;gt; wheel (rim) -&amp;gt; tire (or tyre)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tools&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 tire levelers. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to do it with a single one, but it&amp;rsquo;s harder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A pump. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to postpone filling the tube to the end, but it&amp;rsquo;s
slightly harder.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="remove-the-tube">Remove the tube&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YpP9qi5fawU">Video&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the easier step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One tire lever is enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hold the lever facing away from you, insert it in the right orientation, and
then slide it alongside the tire.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="get-the-right-tube">Get the right tube&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.insportline.eu/advisor/168-how-to-pick-the-correct-tire-and-tube-size">How To Pick the Correct Tire and Tube Size?&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tire size&lt;/strong> is mainly given in inches, with the tires being made in diameters of 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27.5, &lt;strong>28&lt;/strong> and 29 inches.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>700&lt;/strong>: This denotes the wheel diameter, specifically 700c, which is a common
size for road, hybrid, and gravel bikes. In the ISO/ETRTO system, this
corresponds to a 622 mm bead seat diameter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/repair/a20048610/the-difference-between-a-schrader-valve-and-a-presta/">Types of Bike Tire Valves Available&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Bicycles typically come with one of two types of valves. Schrader valves are
the most common; they&amp;rsquo;re the same as those used on cars and are found on many
inexpensive bike models. Most higher-end bicycle tires use Presta, a valve
specifically designed for bikes. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to tell the difference:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can put a Presta-specific tube in a rim drilled for Schrader valves, but
it&amp;rsquo;s not advisable for anything more than an emergency fix. Tubes and tires
tend to move slightly on the rim.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Schrader&lt;/strong>: most common, thicker&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Presta: thinner, with a nut at its tip, more modern&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s also another type called &amp;ldquo;Dunlop&amp;rdquo;, it has similar thickness to
Schrader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My air pump supports both valve types.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="insert-the-tube">Insert the tube&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnP6coXzbLY">Video&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all: pay attention to the rotation direction of the wheel and the tire:
they
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/q61zqa/how_much_does_the_rotation_direction_matter_in/">should&lt;/a>
align. You only commit this mistake once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have more luck by slightly inflating the tube first, and then inserting it in
the wheel (start with the valve). Afterwards, insert the tire in the wheel,
wrapping up the tube.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inserting the tire first, before the tube, yields failure and despair more often
than I would like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not inflate the tube too much, otherwise it becomes quite hard to add the
tire around it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once everything is done, fill in the tube. Pay attention to how much air to pump
in.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>a non-medical condition, primarily associated with writing, in which an author
is either unable to produce new work or experiences a creative slowdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But have you heard of &lt;em>reader&amp;rsquo;s block&lt;/em>?&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Definition&lt;/strong>: a condition wherein a reader is unable to start a new book for a
certain period upon finishing another book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you reach the end of a good book, there are often two feelings you will
experience:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One is pure joy, a sense of accomplishment that feels oddly satisfying. It&amp;rsquo;s an
addiction, part of the machinery of your brain rewarding circuitry that makes
you crave for more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other one? You know it already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes a while to &amp;ldquo;recover&amp;rdquo; from a good book. It&amp;rsquo;s as if the brain didn&amp;rsquo;t want
to forget it too soon, needing some time to process and &amp;ldquo;engrave&amp;rdquo; it in your
mind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This workflow has been in place for at least three months, therefore it&amp;rsquo;s stable
enough by now. Here&amp;rsquo;s the rough idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, create a &lt;code>[[Templates]]&lt;/code> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How to remember whether it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>Templates&lt;/code> or &lt;code>Template&lt;/code>? Simple: add an
&lt;code>alias::template&lt;/code> attribute to the page. It should be the first bullet point.
Now there&amp;rsquo;s no need to remember: any of them will do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then add a &lt;code>[[Gym 💪]]&lt;/code> bullet point&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> with &lt;code>alias::gym&lt;/code>. In it, add a
&lt;code>template::gym&lt;/code> attribute. Within it, add the template content. This is the part
where you should adapt it to your own desires and goals, but I&amp;rsquo;ll share mine:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>- Location
	- [[mygym]] (mylocation1 | mylocation2)
- Defaults
	- 3-4x 8-12
- Warm-up
	- XX min what
- Upper
	- Exercise: 25 -&amp;gt; 30
- Lower
	-
- Cooldown
	- XX min what
- Protein recovery
	- XX g (what)
- Body weight
	- XX kg (gym | home)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>A brief explanation:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>location: links to the page of each gym, where I can add details such as its
Wi-Fi password, how much drinks cost there, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>defaults: the baseline for the session – how many sets, how many repetitions
in each?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>warm-up: what did I do, for how many minutes?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>upper: a bucket to group upper-body exercises: arms, chest, abs, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lower: a bucket to group lower-body exercises: legs, calves, glutes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cooldown: what did I do, for how many minutes?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>protein recovery: in grams, what did I drink or eat?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>body weight: in kilos, and where did I measure it?&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This template has served me well. The most important part is the one that
contains the exercises (upper and lower).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say I am going to the gym today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I open the journal page (&lt;code>[[2025-06-22]]&lt;/code>).
Then I type in &lt;code>/template gym&lt;/code>. This inserts the template above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I click &lt;code>[[Gym 💪]]&lt;/code> to open up the gym page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The gym page contains a detailed explanation of my current goals and workflows.
In particular, it has an exercises reference section that looks like this (the
numbers are made up):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>* # Exercises
* Upper
 * Biceps: 10 -&amp;gt; 12
 * Triceps: 18 -&amp;gt; 20
 * Butterfly normal: 20 -&amp;gt; 25
 * Butterfly reverse: 20 -&amp;gt; 25
 [...]
* Lower
 * Hip addiction: 17 -&amp;gt; 20
 * Hip abduction: 15 -&amp;gt; 20
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Each entry tracks the latest weight and the one before it, which makes the
progression explicit (and doubles-down as a motivation factor!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, because this is an advanced PKM, the backlink we inserted earlier with the
template shows up under &amp;ldquo;linked references&amp;rdquo; at the bottom. And this is the magic
that makes Logseq useful for this kind of tracking: all gym entries are
accessible at a glance, connected to the main &lt;code>[[Gym 💪]]&lt;/code> page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the workout, I use the appropriate weight from the gym page as an input
to the corresponding daily note entry, and slowly increase it in-between sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say that for biceps the reference entry is &lt;code>Biceps: 10 -&amp;gt; 12&lt;/code>. Then, for today&amp;rsquo;s workout, I will add an entry like &lt;code>Biceps: 12 -&amp;gt; 13 -&amp;gt; 14&lt;/code>, starting with &lt;code>12&lt;/code>, the latest reference value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Repeat for each exercise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the workout, I update the reference entries with the progress of
the day. For example, the updated entry for biceps becomes &lt;code>* Biceps: 12 -&amp;gt; 14&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I never liked to go to the gym, but now I am starting to enjoy it, because I
feel this approach brings many self-motivating benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>there&amp;rsquo;s a detailed record of every single workout that I do, down to the day
and the exercise / weight in each set. These entries are psychologically
powerful, they motivate me more than smartwatches and/or gym / workouts apps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the progression ensures I am consistent and pick up where I left off in the
previous session. There&amp;rsquo;s no need to guess any longer which weight to use, I
know exactly which one to use, and whether it was difficult or easy last time
(as I also track this information in the reference).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>reduced risk of injury as I am increasing the weights slowly, and being
mindful of the ones that incur a lot of stress and/or strain on my muscles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ability to track goals and be realistic about them, and even estimate when
I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to reach them, based on historical progression.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I tried to use gym apps before, but they were never effective. They are often
complicated and bloated. The advantage of keeping the format plain and flexible
in the PKM is that it can suit all my needs. In fact, I could even bring pen and
paper to the gym instead of my smartphone if needed, as there&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no
need for internet access when updating these entries, and no lock-in whatsoever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing revolutionary in my approach. Its core is merely: (i)
(annotated!) consistency and (ii) ability to shape the system to the format that
suits/fits my needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consistency is very important. Before adopting this system, I would always guess
which weight to use for each exercise. But there are too many of them, and as
such it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to keep track of them all in my head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The format flexibility is also important. The key is to shape a system to your
needs, not the other way around. With smartphone and smartwatch apps, I always
felt that I had to adapt myself to the input format the app expects, which is
painful from an UX perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now it is time to work out again 💪&lt;/p>

playbook of &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/19/#:~:text=My%20habit%20of%20creating%20long,new%20generation%20of%20coding%20assistants">taking to oneself&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My habit of &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/#issue-thread">creating long issue
threads&lt;/a>
where I talk to myself about the features I&amp;rsquo;m planning is proving to be a good
fit for outsourcing implementation work to this new generation of coding
assistants.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I am mostly interested in leaving a paper trail of my actions and decisions
whilst debugging and investigating a problem or implementing a feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The paper trail doubles down as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>(i) documentation for my teammates, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to repeat myself
during code reviews;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(ii) context for me and my teammates&amp;rsquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> future selves, so that we can
understand &lt;em>why&lt;/em> I chose to do something in a certain way at the time;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(iii) as Simon suggests, context for LLM agents so that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to repeat
myself to them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I find it useful to do so in chat apps (e.g. Slack threads), in addition to bug
trackers (e.g. GitHub Issues or JIRA tickets). Be verbose! The more context the
better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a side note, blog posts yield the same benefit. The more the merrier!&lt;/p>

&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>You can now install your favorite fonts on your Kindle and choose one of them to read your eBooks.

Any font you install must be either an OpenType (OTF) or a TrueType (TTF) font. All other font formats are unsupported. Also, fonts are usually available as a font family and may consist of several files for different font styles - one each for Regular, Italic, Bold, BoldItalic, etc. For the best reading experience, we recommend you install all the files in the font family. Supported font files will have .ttf, .otf, or .ttc file extensions.

How to install fonts on your Kindle:

1. If the font is packaged into a compressed file (such as a ZIP file), uncompress the files using your favorite file extracting program

2. Copy the font files into the &amp;#34;fonts&amp;#34; folder on your Kindle

3. Disconnect your Kindle from the computer

4. You can now choose a custom font in addition to the Kindle fonts from the Display Settings (Aa) menu

Once you choose a custom font from the Display Settings (Aa) menu, your Kindle will render the book content using that font for most books. If the font is not able to be used for rendering the book&amp;#39;s content, your Kindle will use the default system font instead. This can happen if the font does not support the characters in the book or if the font is damaged.

Amazon respects the intellectual property of others. You are responsible for ensuring you have obtained the necessary rights and permissions to use any fonts you upload to your Kindle. By using the font upload functionality on Kindle, you agree that your use of the fonts you upload will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, and that you will indemnify Amazon for all claims resulting from your use of the fonts you upload.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bad&lt;/strong>™:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that I sometimes use direct messages when I should be asking a
question in a public channel. Upon examination, direct messages have the
following attributes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Less intrusive. I sometimes worry about an excessive amount of chatter
bothering other team members.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Protect my ego. When I ask a question it is admitting that I don&amp;rsquo;t know the
answer. As a &amp;ldquo;director of engineering&amp;rdquo; it can be humbling to admit
ignorance. But of course I don&amp;rsquo;t know everything! It&amp;rsquo;s just my ego talking.
However, it still stings a bit sometimes to ask publicly–it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just
side chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Good&lt;/strong>™:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>However, the benefits of posting in a public channel are many. A message in a
public channel is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Viewable. This means that others can chime in (as opposed to just the person
I DMed). And that others can learn in the present as they read my question
and the answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Linkable. This means that if I want to reference the conversation (in a PR,
trello card or elsewhere), I can. Of course, I should extract info into
documentation (future me will thank past me) but for context around a
decision, a link to a slack chat can be very helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Searchable. This means that others in the future who are searching for this
information can find it. Yes, slack&amp;rsquo;s search leaves something to be desired,
but if the conversation is private, that&amp;rsquo;s a guarantee that no one else will
be able to search and find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Vulnerable. I want everyone to feel comfortable asking questions. That leads
to better outcomes for clients and for team members. How can I expect that
behavior of others if I don&amp;rsquo;t do it myself?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Surprisingly, I&amp;rsquo;ve had many teammates throughout the years that are unaware of
these benefits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One more for &lt;strong>Bad&lt;/strong> (direct messages):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No load balancing&lt;/strong>. Risk of bothering one person instead of distributing
question load amongst the team.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One more for &lt;strong>Good&lt;/strong> (public messages):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Knowledge sharing&lt;/strong>. What you ask, you learn. What you learn, your teammates
also learn. Win-win!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Paolo the plumber</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/06/paolo-the-plumber/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 21:48:48 +0200</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/06/paolo-the-plumber/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://endler.dev/2025/paolo/">Paolo the plumber&lt;/a> by Matthias Endler.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2025/05/kagi/">Previously&lt;/a>, I wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The question to ask yourself is whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth paying $10 / month for
their professional plan, or whether DuckDuckGo is enough for you. If you can
have your company expense them, then it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a no-brainer.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My company approved my request to expense it, therefore I am going to buy their
&lt;a href="https://kagi.com/pricing">1-year Professional plan&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, a few observations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Would I pay for it out of my own pocket? Probably no. It&amp;rsquo;s perfectly
reasonable and enough for my purposes to use a blend of &lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2024/12/switching-from-google-to-chatgpt-search/">DuckDuckGo + ChatGPT
Search&lt;/a>.
That said, Kagi provides extra value to me on top of that duo; I prefer using
it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Once you grow accustomed with search results without ads it&amp;rsquo;s very, very hard
to go back. Searching on Google suddenly feels like a thing of the past. It&amp;rsquo;s
very similar to the experience of getting used to ad-blocking software in the
web browser and then suddenly turning them off. The Web feels messy and
bloated.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I did 961 searches at the time of this post, with 18 assistant interactions. I
barely use their AI features because I prefer the OpenAI ChatGPT experience.
Nonetheless, their AI features are occasionally handy and I find them to be
integrated in a non-intrusive way.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong>: Go for Kagi iff you can expense it.

And
this is something I would like to change. Allow me to explain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a myriad of ideas in my head. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been noting down some of them
in my &lt;a href="https://logseq.com/">PKM&lt;/a>, which reduces stress. On the other hand, most
of these ideas ended up becoming abandoned bullet points, lost in the sea of
interconnected pages in my knowledge graph.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know what to do when I want to convert an idea into reality: the very first
step is to add it to my &lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">task manager&lt;/a>, and
then schedule / prioritize it. This is a superpower that I love: it&amp;rsquo;s virtually
impossible to forget anything that ends up in the task manager. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s tax
season, or a random deadline to apply for something, or to cancel a recurring
subscription, or to buy tickets for a concert&amp;hellip;full stop. The difficulty lies
in breaking down a large(r) and/or long(er)-term project into smaller,
actionable pieces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is at least one missing piece in my current workflow (and environment),
which I am still trying to figure out, to close the loop and become 10x more
productive, reducing the time between the conception of an idea and its
implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best example that illustrates it is &lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2024/10/new-series-raspberry-pi-fun-with-devops/">that post&lt;/a> about the Raspberry
Pi. It never took off (and it&amp;rsquo;s still in my backlog!). Another example is the
&lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2025/05/winterbreak-hello-world/">Kindle jailbreak&lt;/a> – it took
me 4-5 months to do it. Once I started it, it took me only a few minutes to
start it&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. So the major bottleneck is to kick start a project. I am very
confident in my current skill set and knowledge for the execution once it has
taken off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What can I do in order to be more effective in terms of converting abstract
ideas into small, concrete and actionable items?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The discovery journey continues&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn:1">
&lt;p>&lt;em>Hours&lt;/em>, if you account for taking notes plus waiting for the process to
complete.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:2">
&lt;p>Why is the title &amp;ldquo;limited creativity&amp;rdquo; if, apparently, the flow of ideas
doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this somewhat paradoxical? I take a practical
standpoint: it&amp;rsquo;s useless to have a myriad of ideas if they do not become
concrete. Virtual ideas are essentially the same as nothing. Output (or
deliverables, if you will) is the metric that matters most of the time.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>How many Rs in RaspBerry?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Model&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thinking:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Interpreting the user&amp;rsquo;s intent&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently focused on dissecting the user&amp;rsquo;s query. The unconventional
capitalization in &amp;ldquo;RaspBerry&amp;rdquo; has piqued my interest. I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s
a specific reason for this. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a stylistic choice, or it could
subtly influence the desired outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Determining the final answer&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve analyzed the query, and determined the intended word, I&amp;rsquo;ve
confirmed the spelling is r-a-s-p-b-e-r-r-y. I&amp;rsquo;ve conducted the letter count
and it&amp;rsquo;s clear there are three &amp;lsquo;R&amp;rsquo;s in total. I&amp;rsquo;m formulating the answer,
keeping in mind the unusual capitalization but leaning towards simplicity.
Since the question is about an entity, the answer is three.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Output:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Even with the capitalization as &amp;ldquo;RaspBerry,&amp;rdquo; there are still two Rs in the word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R-a-s-p-B-e-r-r-y&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The capitalization doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the letters that make up the word.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Despite using chain-of-thought (&amp;ldquo;thinking mode&amp;rdquo;) and correctly getting the right
answer (&lt;strong>three&lt;/strong>) – a significant improvement compared to previous models – the
final answer is still &lt;strong>two&lt;/strong>. The &amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; part is hidden from the user by
default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I do an exam in university and produce an incorrect final answer, despite
giving a correct answer in the middle (whilst babbling my reasoning), my final
grade is &lt;strong>zero&lt;/strong>. Just saying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I know how an LLM works (next token prediction, tokenizer, et cetera) but
we&amp;rsquo;re in 2025 and this is a thinking model, aggressively marketed and shoveled
everywhere, even when unprompted (pun intended). To say it does not meet
expectations is an understatement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For comparison: &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68320d74-9310-8009-874c-adde37eeb810">OpenAI /
ChatGPT&lt;/a> gets it
right.

&lt;p>We recommend using the word &amp;ldquo;think&amp;rdquo; to trigger extended thinking mode, which
gives Claude additional computation time to evaluate alternatives more

&lt;p>Life happens though, and only now I got time to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I took one important precaution since then, which was &lt;em>essential&lt;/em>:
ensure my Kindle was &lt;em>always&lt;/em> in airplane mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whenever the Kindle is connected to Wi-Fi, it gets
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_update">OTA updates&lt;/a> automatically
from Amazon. This is generally a sensible default and the desired behavior.
However, for jailbreaking purposes, you want your device to stay stuck on time
and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA4iX5D9Z64">&lt;em>never ever ever&lt;/em>&lt;/a> get
updates. An update could make the jailbreak cease to work. In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s
exactly what happened during these last 4-5 months:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>*Note that models on 5.18.x no longer work, please check the wiki&amp;rsquo;s model list
for more info&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I was prudent to verify it was still running 5.17.x before proceeding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The expected time to do the whole process was about half an hour, and it&amp;rsquo;s super
user-friendly. Seriously, the folks at &lt;a href="https://kindlemodding.org/">Kindle
Modding&lt;/a> did an amazing documentation job; arguably
the procedures are friendly even to non-developers. The process boils down to
connecting your Kindle to a laptop (the OS doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter), copying a
bunch of files and directories over to it, ejecting it, tapping some buttons,
and repeating this procedure a couple of times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me it took about one hour, because I was careful to take photos (in case I
screwed up) and notes (for this blog post, and also for the sake of reverting
the process should I want to – for example, if I ever sell the device to a third
party).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before deciding to do it, I watched
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ59M0io6zE">this&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtk7ERwlIAk">this
video&lt;/a> which made me feel even more
confident it is the outcome I was longing for. &lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2024/12/independence/">Previously&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t document the jailbreak procedure here: there&amp;rsquo;s no point. First, the
upstream documentation is amazing; second, the steps here would likely easily
get outdated. Head over to &lt;a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/">the WinterBreak
docs&lt;/a>. Even better, read
the &lt;a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/jailbreak-faq.html">FAQ&lt;/a> first. That
said, here are a few notes and anecdotes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to disable parental controls on my Kindle. I had them enabled to prevent
me from accidentally buying books from the Amazon Store&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. This is the closest
to adblocking I could find, and I was happy with that setting. That said, one of
the jailbreak steps is to open the store, therefore the parental controls must
be turned off. This is not documented upstream – to be honest, most people
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in that situation anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process failed in the first attempt. I am not quite sure why. It got stuck
at the &lt;code>Jailbreaking - please wait...&lt;/code> screen. The docs say:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you do not see any funky text then make sure Airplane mode is disabled to
avoid any automatic update. Turn it back on after you see the text though!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That was not helpful to me though. What worked was to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UT8RkSmN4k">restart the
device&lt;/a> and try again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second attempt worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the jailbreak is done, head over to &lt;a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/">Post
Jailbreak&lt;/a>. Steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>set up a hotfix: to ensure the jailbreak persists, even after restarting the
device&lt;/li>
&lt;li>install KUAL &amp;amp; MRPI: package managers, basically&lt;/li>
&lt;li>disable OTA updates: important to ensure an automatic update does not revert
the jailbreak&lt;/li>
&lt;li>re-enable the store: not super relevant for me, but why not – and then turn
parental controls back on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>install &lt;a href="https://koreader.rocks/">KOReader&lt;/a>: surely this is the most exciting
part&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>KOReader is a document viewer for E Ink devices. Supported fileformats include
EPUB, PDF, DjVu, XPS, CBT, CBZ, FB2, PDB, TXT, HTML, RTF, CHM, DOC, MOBI and
ZIP files. It&amp;rsquo;s available for Kindle, Kobo, PocketBook, Android and desktop
Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A few highlights from the FAQ:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Is it possible to undo the jailbreak (&amp;ldquo;unjailbreak&amp;rdquo;)?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, perform a factory reset on the device and then install the same firmware
update (or higher).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This makes the action of doing the jailbreak a no-brainer. Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s always
a (small) chance of bricking your device, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth the risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Will this get my Amazon account banned?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No reports of Amazon accounts being banned after jailbreaking have been
reported so far. However, please refrain from telling support that you have
modified your device.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Common sense. I never contacted Amazon Support in 11+ years of owning Kindles,
so I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care about it anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Will this void the warranty on my Kindle device?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probably.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is always the case with jailbreaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to commit when you have an old device that is already out of
the warranty period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Avoid jailbreaking brand new devices. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Can I still use the default reader after jailbreaking?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s true: I verified it. This is great. In the (unlikely) case I find out that
KOReader sucks&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to regret it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Is it possible to change screensavers in the native Kindle UI?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although there are currently no extensions to change the screensavers in
hard-float firmware, it is still possible to change them, but it is not
recommended as it is very easy to brick the device.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Noted. But:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can easily change screensavers with KOReader (search for the
&amp;ldquo;screensavers&amp;rdquo; feature).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How can I check if my device is jailbroken?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Type &lt;code>;log&lt;/code> into the search bar, if a message pop ups, you&amp;rsquo;re jailbroken.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And now I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cannot stress this enough: it&amp;rsquo;s very important to read the docs thoroughly
before deciding to jailbreak. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll write a follow-up post-jailbreaking user experience blog post.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Enter &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_directory">blog directories&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There are two ways to find information on the Web: by searching or browsing.
Web directories provide links in a structured list to make browsing easier.
Many web directories combine searching and browsing by providing a search
engine to search the directory. Unlike search engines, which base results on
a database of entries gathered automatically by web crawler, most web
directories are built manually by human editors. Many web directories allow
site owners to submit their site for inclusion, and have editors review
submissions for fitness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A few directories I like&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>✪ &lt;a href="https://diff.blog/">https://diff.blog/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>✪ &lt;a href="https://512kb.club/">https://512kb.club/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://marginalia-search.com/">https://marginalia-search.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I tend to visit them occasionally, whenever I crave for new content, perhaps like
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling">doomscrolling&lt;/a> in social media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most new blogs I subscribe to come from indirect referrals. I read a blog post I
like that links to another blog post, I visit it to find out more and realize
that it&amp;rsquo;s interesting, then I subscribe to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More rarely there&amp;rsquo;s also the direct referral way, for example, when I become
aware that a friend or a coworker has started a blog recently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The combination of referrals + directories is quite sustainable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/stack-overflow-is-almost-dead/">Stack overflow is almost dead&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> by Gergely Orosz:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Four months ago, we asked Are LLMs making Stack Overflow irrelevant? Data at
the time suggested that the answer is likely &amp;ldquo;yes:&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, things at Stack Overflow went from bad to worse. The volume of
questions asked has nearly dried up, new data shows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tallies with my memory of feeling that site moderators had gone on a
power trip by closing legitimate questions. I stopped asking questions around
this time because the site felt unwelcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ChatGPT is faster and it&amp;rsquo;s trained on StackOverflow data, so the quality of
answers is similar. Plus, ChatGPT is polite and answers all questions, in
contrast to StackOverflow moderators.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A bit of politeness&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> goes a long way, eh?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where do you ask novel questions these days?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stack Exchange is still my to-go site for that, but it&amp;rsquo;s starting to feel like a
ghost town. Oftentimes I end up self-answering my own question, because no one
else does. Nonetheless, I&amp;rsquo;d rather post on my blog if I know the answer in
advance. The reason to post on SE is when &lt;em>I don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels to me the best place to ask specific questions these days is wherever
the project is developed. GitHub or GitLab issues, Discourse (BBS / forums),
Discord&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, Slack&amp;hellip;and so on. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fragmentation. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s
not too bad after all, but it incurs additional effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And where to ask general questions? Reddit&lt;sup id="fnref1:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, the Fediverse™, social media,
project-agnostic chat platforms / communities&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps one day we&amp;rsquo;ll just be able to tell our LLM agents to go out there in the
dark corners of the Web&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> to ask a question for us.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Steven Ovadia – January 20th, 2015 – 0 Comments&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Thiago touches on a number of interesting points. For instance, he talks about
testing out new distributions and desktops to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on in Linux.
That&amp;rsquo;s something I kind of have to remind myself to do. Everything works well on
my main workhorse (knock wood…) so I have no natural desire to try out other
distributions and desktops. But I try and remember to give different things a
spin, just so I know if there&amp;rsquo;s something better out there, or if there&amp;rsquo;s
something I should steal for my own system. Finally, Thiago pays respect to his
package manager, which is super classy. Package managers are the unsung heroes
of most setups and without them, we&amp;rsquo;d probably have a rougher time trying new
things out.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You can find more of The Linux Setup here.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You can follow Linux Rig on Google+ here and follow me on Twitter here.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Who are you, and what do you do?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a Computer and Information Engineering student living in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. I usually use the &amp;rsquo;thiagowfx&amp;rsquo; nickname and I&amp;rsquo;d say I am a
free/open source software and community enthusiast. In particular, today I am an
active member of the Arch Linux community. I also have a blog where I write
about projects I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on and new technology and software I&amp;rsquo;m
trying out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Why do you use Linux?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Questions we are passionate about are the hardest to answer. But hey, today I&amp;rsquo;d say I use Linux for at least for three reasons (not in any particular order):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>community: it is very hard to find a diverse and rich community such as the
GNU/Linux one;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>open source software: this is very important and includes implications on
philosophy and programming (e.g., pull requests);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>package managers!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. What distribution do you run on your main desktop/laptop?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time, on a monthly basis, I was always switching distributions.
However, during the last year I discovered the one I most enjoy today: Arch
Linux. It is a very customizable, follows KISS (&amp;lsquo;Keep it Short &amp;amp; Simple&amp;rsquo;) and is
a user-centered distro, with a very nice and intelligent community. I still test
the latest improvements of other Linux distributions every now and then, even
though this is less frequent today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. What desktop environment do you use and why do you use it?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am always switching desktop environments, mainly because I like to keep up to
date with the latest improvements on the Linux desktop (as with distros).
However, I&amp;rsquo;d say the two I use and like most are Cinnamon and i3. Usually I use
Cinnamon at home and i3 elsewhere (when I don&amp;rsquo;t have a mouse with me).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. What one piece of software do you depend upon with this distribution? Why is it so important?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Package manager: it is the piece of software I most value. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to
live without one anymore. In particular, pacman is my preferred one. Now, if you
were referring to end-user software, I have no doubt that Emacs is the software
I most use today, although I am giving Vim a try. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not dependent of
any software in particular; each task has its own needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6. What kind of hardware do you run this setup on?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently I have a Lenovo Ideapad S400U Ultrabook, which has an Intel Core i5
processor, 4GB RAM and an Intel Graphics HD 4000 graphics card. It
supports Linux pretty well and out-of-the-box with Intel open source drivers. It
has a small SSD (32GB) where I keep the root partition of whichever Linux
distribution I&amp;rsquo;m using at the moment, and a 500GB HDD where I keep my /home and
an alternate Linux distro.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>7. Will you share a screenshot of your desktop?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;ve said, I&amp;rsquo;m always switching desktop environments. However, I keep an
album on Flickr with my latest screenshots. This is the last one I
took, on Arch Linux, with KDE 4.14.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Interview conducted October 5, 2014&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>The Linux Setup&lt;/strong> is a feature where I interview people about their Linux
setups. The concept is borrowed, if not outright stolen, from this site. If
you&amp;rsquo;d like to participate, drop me a line.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was waiting for this moment when the overloaded &amp;ldquo;Cursor&amp;rdquo; term would become
ambiguous. It&amp;rsquo;s just somewhat of a funny coincidence that it appeared in the

&lt;a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pre-commit/issues/130">filed&lt;/a> a high-quality
feature request for a software project I am interested to adopt. What makes it
great™:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>describe &lt;strong>concisely&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>precisely&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>what&lt;/strong> you&amp;rsquo;re looking for&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>being concise is essential: we live in a fast-paced world. If no one looks
at your FR, then it won&amp;rsquo;t move forward. Period.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>being precise (unambiguous) is important to avoid back-and-forth and
potential bikeshedding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I prefer to write it using my own words. Using an LLM risks making your FR
robotic and unappealing for anyone to consider. YMMV.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>describe &lt;strong>why&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>what is the &lt;em>raison d&amp;rsquo;être&lt;/em> of the feature? What is the rationale behind it?
How does it make the project better? How does it improve the developer
experience?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>(&lt;em>optional&lt;/em>, but &lt;strong>highly recommended&lt;/strong>) suggest &lt;strong>how&lt;/strong> and offer to address it&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Everyone wants everything, but few people want to put in the effort to see
changes take place. Your FR has a much higher chance of becoming reality if
you volunteer your time, effort and expertise to implement the feature
yourself, rather than &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">demanding&lt;/a> someone (likely an
unpaid volunteer) to do so for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In my experience it&amp;rsquo;s better to file an issue / ticket / FR first, &lt;strong>prior to&lt;/strong>
sending a pull request. You &lt;em>cannot&lt;/em> know in advance whether the FR is welcome
by the project or its maintainers. Sending in a PR just to see its underlying
&lt;em>raison d&amp;rsquo;être&lt;/em> be rejected is a waste of time, besides being a frustrating
experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, the ticket doubles-down as documentation for the PR description /
commit message in the future, should the FR be accepted. The small overhead of
time to file a ticket is a reasonable trade-off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, even if your FR is great and very reasonable&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, there&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no
guarantee:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you will even get a reply in the first place&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>back-and-forth chatter will be quick and responsive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the maintainers / developers will agree with your sense of &amp;lsquo;usefulness&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the maintainers / developers will agree with &lt;em>how&lt;/em> you believe it should be
tackled or implemented&lt;/li>
&lt;li>your follow-up PR will even be reviewed and, let alone, merged&lt;/li>
&lt;li>your merged PR will make it into a new point release&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Life is hard&lt;/em>. Nonetheless, do not give up! Open source software is beautiful
and serendipitous. :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">Kagi Small Web&lt;/a> is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>the non-commercial part of the web, crafted by individuals to express
themselves or share knowledge without seeking any financial gain. This concept
often evokes nostalgia for the early, less commercialized days of the web,
before the ad-supported business model took over the internet (and we started
fighting back!)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">Context&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kagi supports searching websites within the Small Web via a &lt;a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/lenses.html">dedicated
lens&lt;/a> (think of it as a search
scope).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also provide a integrated &lt;a href="https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed/">RSS
feed&lt;/a> (think of it as a &amp;ldquo;small web
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">planet&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And, also, a &lt;a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">navigator&lt;/a> (think of it as StumbleUpon
or Digg in the early days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The small web somewhat correlates with the &lt;a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is the IndieWeb?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the &amp;ldquo;corporate web&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are a community of independent and personal websites based on the
principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online
identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning
your content.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is a great source of serendipity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ByteBurst Brigade</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/05/byteburst-brigade/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 17:56:02 +0200</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/05/byteburst-brigade/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have Telegram, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome to join &lt;a href="https://t.me/+OzLfJRhjA69iNWFh">ByteBurst

&lt;p>Why would you use something other than Google, you may ask? &lt;a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over">That&amp;rsquo;s out of scope
of this post&lt;/a>. If you think Google is
the best and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to replace your search engine, this post is not for
you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while ago I had &lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2024/12/switching-from-google-to-chatgpt-search/">switched&lt;/a> my default search
engine from Google to ChatGPT Search, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t last long; eventually I
settled on &lt;a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week, a friend told me he got a trial of Kagi. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of it: &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/try_switching_to_kagi">John
Gruber&lt;/a> also blogged
about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I decided to try it out myself as well. In general I am happy with
DuckDuckGo, but we can always try something new, and the company materials have
really impressed me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I emailed someone at the company and got an 1-month trial of their
&lt;a href="https://kagi.com/pricing">Professional plan&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> – which includes &lt;strong>unlimited&lt;/strong>
searches. This is important: there should be no decision fatigue nor anxiety
about hitting a ceiling in the number of monthly searches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is Kagi? In a Nutshell:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Kagi has no ads and is fully supported only by its users. We worked very hard
to provide high quality, fast and tracking-free results at a minimum cost to
ensure sustainability of our operation. By choosing a paid Kagi plan, you are
also helping accelerate our mission of humanizing the web.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why should I pay for search?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re already paying with your time and attention to advertisers who
manipulate your search results, waste your time, and exploit your privacy. Pay
with your wallet instead of your life, and get pure, powerful search that
works for you - not advertisers. Read more.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What happens if I don&amp;rsquo;t use any searches?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In months where you don&amp;rsquo;t utilize any searches on your plan, we will
automatically apply a full credit to your account. This credit will be applied
to your next billing cycle, effectively covering your subsequent month&amp;rsquo;s
subscription at no additional cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>See also their &lt;a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/faq/faq.html">FAQ&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://kagi.com/privacy">privacy
policy&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why does Kagi return so few results?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kagi only shows you actually relevant search results, so you may be confused
when Kagi returns 57 results and another, ad supported, search engine returns
2.6 million results. This is, in part, because ad supported search engines
have different incentives and want you to stay on their site longer, going
through pages and pages of results, as every interaction is another
opportunity to serve ads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kagi, conversely, strives to deliver the most relevant, unique results within
the top three.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What data does Kagi collect?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only bare necessities to run the service. Please see our privacy policy and
our documentation about privacy protection for more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Kagi&amp;rsquo;s business model is unlike any other search engine in the world. This
means we don&amp;rsquo;t need or want your personal information (it would just be an
unwelcome liability). By choosing this business model we know that we are
going to have far less users than mainstream search engine for example, but we
have also removed any incentive to misuse any information you have shared with
us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Privacy is a Kagi Feature&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At Kagi, you are our customer, not the product being sold The deal is simple:
Our customers pay for a service and we provide them with a service. This
business model ensures Kagi&amp;rsquo;s and our customers&amp;rsquo; interests are always aligned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We value your privacy, and whenever possible we will choose not to require or
save any user data. For Kagi, user data is only a liability - we do not need
or want it. Still, operating a paid service may require some basic information
from our customers, and this document describes how we use it to the best of
our ability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See for yourself Our technology choices show we&amp;rsquo;re serious about privacy. You
can check them in your browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike most websites, we do not load any analytics or telemetry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike most search engines, we do not track which search result you choose to
click.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When viewing images, videos or other media results, or using the Kagi
Assistant, we protect your privacy by proxying all connections and data
through our servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We store only the bare minimum of cookies, those required to handle basic
application functionality, such as logging in.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I am currently digging through their
&lt;a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/">documentation&lt;/a>. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to read! There&amp;rsquo;s no
need to, but I am trying to assess whether to pay for them once the trial ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall I am quite bullish about them. I have already updated all my browsers in
all my devices (including work) to them. I believe immersion is a very effective
way to evaluate a product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They support &lt;a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html">bangs&lt;/a>, just like
DuckDuckGo, meaning that I can append (for example) &lt;code>!g&lt;/code> or &lt;code>!ddg&lt;/code> to bail out
to Google or DuckDuckGo, respectively. I find their user experience around bangs
much better than DuckDuckGo&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>first, there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://kbe.smaertness.net/">bang explorer&lt;/a>
(community-created), and the bang sources are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/bangs">open&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it&amp;rsquo;s possible to add custom bangs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it&amp;rsquo;s possible to add custom search engines&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a practical example: I can invoke their
&lt;a href="https://kagi.com/summarizer">Summarizer&lt;/a> to make a summary of a page:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>!sum &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Or &amp;ldquo;I am feeling lucky&amp;rdquo; with &lt;code>! {search term}&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/overview.html">API access&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-translate">Translation&lt;/a> (Kagi
Translate), accessible at
&lt;a href="https://translate.kagi.com/">https://translate.kagi.com/&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Add translate.kagi.com/ before any URL for instant translation. No apps
needed. Access 244 languages with zero tracking. Install our browser
bookmarklet for quick access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kagi Translate is free for everyone. If you&amp;rsquo;re not a logged in Kagi user,
you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter a simple captcha to prevent automated abuse - a small step
that helps us maintain quality while keeping the service free. Kagi members
get direct access without captchas, integrating seamlessly with their existing
workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://kagi.com/stats">Kagi Search Stats&lt;/a>: it keeps healthily growing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/search-details/search-speed.html">Kagi Performance&lt;/a>:
it is fast and lightweight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you append a question mark (&lt;code>?&lt;/code>) to a search query, then it automatically
invokes a LLM (&lt;a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/quick-answer.html">&amp;lsquo;quick
answer&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a>) to summarize results:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Even with an engine as powerful as Kagi you may not be interested in reading
every resulting page and want a synthesis of the information as well as
references to important pages in the search result. Kagi&amp;rsquo;s Quick Answer
quickly produces a summary of the results across the pages returned and
provides references to the pages that are used. This functionality allows you
to quickly consume the desired information from the search while giving you
the pointers to dive deeper into the information if desired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have search results returned you can select Quick Answer to quickly
transform the information on the page into the easier to digest format.
Additionally, if you add a question mark at the end of your query (&amp;quot;?&amp;quot;) Quick
Answers will trigger automatically, making it even more convenient to get to
the information you need swiftly. You can also trigger Quick Answer by
pressing &amp;lsquo;q&amp;rsquo; on your keyboard, after the results have loaded.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll end this post now, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d just be parroting the entire Kagi
Documentation here. &lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong>: So far, so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Edit(2025-05-14)&lt;/strong>: After using Kagi for about 10 days, I am happy to report
that I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite happy with them. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt they have a great
product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question to ask yourself is whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth paying $10 / month for
their professional plan, or whether DuckDuckGo is enough for you. If you can
have your company expense them, then it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a no-brainer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hi hn - I co-own a diner where I co-host a puzzle night that is kind of like a
diner-themed escape room. At the last one, I made a puzzle that was
crossword-like clues nested in brackets. People at the diner seemed to like
it, so I resolved to make it a real game and Bracket City was born:
&lt;a href="https://bracket.city/">https://bracket.city&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I posted Bracket City to HN on February 24th and the game went live yesterday
on The Atlantic (!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The game will stay free to play (and not require logging in). Also, I&amp;rsquo;m still
making all the puzzles!&lt;/p>

find its PDF manual to figure out how to properly assemble it. The previous
owner did not have a copy available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First step: Figure out what the make (manufacturer) is. Easy, there&amp;rsquo;s a label
attached to the table, it&amp;rsquo;s Finori. The label, unfortunately, does not include
the model name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second step: Try to find the table model in the Finori website. No success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I go to &lt;a href="https://www.idealo.de/">idealo&lt;/a> and search for &amp;ldquo;Finori
Ausziehtisch&amp;rdquo;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the exact model, but I got a similar one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somehow I ended up in Otto and found the right model&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. There&amp;rsquo;s no PDF manual
though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I go to &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/">SearchGPT&lt;/a> and prompt, with both search and
thinking enabled:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Can you help me find the manual of this table? {link to the otto.de listing}&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It got me some similar models, but not the exact one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point I got linked to an IKEA extendable table assembly video on
YouTube. The video was enough to figure out the remaining steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conclusion is: IKEA is like the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page">ArchWiki&lt;/a> of assembling furniture.
Even when assembling models from other manufacturers, it will surely help you!&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One of the minor puzzles of American life is what question to ask people at
parties and suchly to get to know them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How ya doin&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; is of course mere formality, only the most troubled would
answer honestly for anything but the positive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What do you do?&amp;rdquo; is somewhat offensive. First, it really means &amp;ldquo;what
occupation do you hold?&amp;rdquo; and thus implies you do little outside your
occupation. Second, it implies that one&amp;rsquo;s occupation is the most salient fact
about them. Third, it rarely leads to further useful inquiry. For only a
handful of occupations, you will be able to say something somewhat relevant,
but even this will no doubt be slightly annoying or offensive. (&amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, I
always thought about studying history.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Where are you from?&amp;rdquo; is even less fruitful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I propose instead that one ask &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;What have you been thinking about lately?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>
First, the question is extremely open-ended. The answer could be a book, a
movie, a relationship, a class, a job, a hobby, etc. Even better, it will be
whichever of these is most interesting at the moment. Second, it sends the
message that thinking, and thinking about thinking, is a fundamental human
activity, and thus encourages it. Third, it&amp;rsquo;s easiest to answer, since by its
nature its asking about what&amp;rsquo;s already on the person&amp;rsquo;s mind. Fourth, it&amp;rsquo;s
likely to lead to productive dialog, as you can discuss the topic together and
hopefully make progress. Fifth, the answer is quite likely to be novel. Unlike
books and occupations, people&amp;rsquo;s thoughts seem to be endlessly varied. Sixth,
it helps capture a person&amp;rsquo;s essence. A job can be forced by circumstance and
parentage, but our thoughts are all our own. I can think of little better way
to quickly gauge what a person is really like.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(emphasis mine)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what have you been thinking about lately?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overnight Oats</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/04/overnight-oats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 13:09:31 +0200</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/04/overnight-oats/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post premieres a &lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/tags/recipe">&lt;code>#recipe&lt;/code>&lt;/a> tag in this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I like about this recipe is that it is quite freestyle, one can mix and
match whichever ingredients are available at hand. In my place most
ingredients are almost always available, only fresh fruits have high churn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make it fun by adding / removing ingredients at the last
minute, tweaking the overall result each time. The sky is the limit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend to have it for &lt;strong>breakfast&lt;/strong> (it&amp;rsquo;s enough!) or as an &lt;strong>afternoon snack&lt;/strong>
(for example, bring a Tupperware to work).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important ingredients are &lt;strong>in bold&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coolest™ ingredients are &lt;em>in italics&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>base (pick at least one)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>milk&lt;/strong> (animal or not; prefer low-fat)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>plain yogurt (greek, vanilla also OK)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>high-protein yogurt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>semolina pudding&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avoid: water&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>grains (pick at least two)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>oats&lt;/strong> (steel-cut or rolled -&amp;gt; auf Deutsch: Haferflocken)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>chia seeds&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flax seeds&lt;/li>

&lt;li>avoid: cereal (Müsli)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sweet(ener) (pick at least one)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>peanut butter&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>almond butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>maple syrup&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>avoid: sugar / brown sugar&lt;/li>

&lt;li>fruits (pick at least one)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>bananas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>strawberries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>raspberries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>blueberries&lt;/li>

&lt;p>These are overnight oats, therefore they should ideally be prepared one day
before you intend to consume them. The intent is to leave them simmering in the
fridge while you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping. Needless to say, it will be served &lt;strong>cold&lt;/strong>.
There&amp;rsquo;s a variant of this recipe that is served hot, but it&amp;rsquo;s out of scope of
this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Grab a dish to mix the ingredients within. Ideally, &lt;strong>a container with a lid&lt;/strong>
so that it can be stored in the fridge right away once we&amp;rsquo;re done.
Alternatively, a bowl will also do. Don&amp;rsquo;t get a plate. Some people like to do it
in cups (preferably a big cup if you want to eat enough!).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Start by adding the base. Normally I will do milk (always available) + some
plain yogurt if available. Cold milk, do not add hot milk! Room temperature is
also OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add your grains. Oats are essential. Chia and flex seeds are nice to have.
Anything else is a bonus.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add your sweet(ener)s. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re on a diet. But frankly, even if you are,
do add some, just be moderate. Peanut or almond butter are perfect. I also
love to add maple syrup, but I typically defer it for later, right before
eating the oats. The same applies to honey.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Mix everything. Preferably with a spoon.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Put the container in the fridge. Good night!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="the-second-day">The second day&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The fruits should be cut in small pieces. Add them to the container.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add other sweeteneers (as previously mentioned: maple syrup, honey, etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s done. Enjoy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: When in a rush, you can prepare and eat the oats within the same day.
Just leave them in the fridge for &lt;em>at least&lt;/em> one hour.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Definitions set, here comes the fun part:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lemma #1&lt;/strong>: Gatekeepers are, by definition, the opposite of serendipity
spreaders. You can visualize them in a 2D scale, from left to right, somewhat
akin to how people attempt to project politics onto a line.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lemma #2&lt;/strong>: Open Source Software (OSS) is a gift™ driven primarily by
serendipity spreaders.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lemma #3&lt;/strong>: In terms of friendships, the optimal point of joy and
satisfaction lies within seeking and maintaining serendipity spreaders whilst
avoiding gatekeepers at all costs. It yields a rewarding continuous feedback
loop.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lemma #4&lt;/strong>: Gatekeepers drag serendipity spreaders down. They are like
leeches (parasites).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lemma #5&lt;/strong>: Serendipity spreaders thrive together.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lemma #6&lt;/strong>: In a set full of serendipity spreaders, one gatekeeper is enough
to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">disrupt&lt;/a> the entire
group, thereby leading to the conversion of new gatekeepers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lemma #7&lt;/strong>: In a set full of gatekeepers, one serendipity spreader is enough
to spread serendipity; however, the bar to convert to more serendipity
spreaders is extremely high, and it&amp;rsquo;s very taxing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Several conclusions can be drawn from these lemmas; nonetheless, this is not a
blog about philosophy or morals, therefore the exercise is left to the reader.&lt;/p>

allows setting a status on your profile page:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can now set your status on GitHub! Use your status to share specific
information with only your organization, or share a status with all of GitHub!
Optionally, you can indicate that you&amp;rsquo;re busy so your collaborators can
determine whether to mention someone else for a quicker response.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;strong>TL;DR&lt;/strong>: The most practical use case is to set your profile to &amp;ldquo;Busy&amp;rdquo; whenever
you take time off (whether it&amp;rsquo;s vacation or sick leave).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s possible to limit the status visibility to a single organization, so that
it is not publicly visible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to automatically clear the status after a given period (e.g.
one week).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is this useful?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>signal to your teammates that you&amp;rsquo;re OOO, without leaving then wondering why
you&amp;rsquo;re taking forever to review their PRs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>prevent team assignments in PR reviews to automatically select you when you&amp;rsquo;re
OOO:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you select the &amp;ldquo;Busy&amp;rdquo; option, when people @mention your username, assign
you an issue or pull request, or request a pull request review from you, a
note next to your username will show that you&amp;rsquo;re busy. You will also be
excluded from automatic review assignment for pull requests assigned to any
teams you belong to. For more information, see Managing code review settings

folks are already writing extensive articles about it, as if they had been

&lt;p>It resembles people giving advice about COVID-19 a few years ago, or about
finance and/or taxes and/or parenting in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am guessing that surfing the {insert current hype wave} is the way to go,
assuming you follow internet advice™.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless the challenge is, as everything else in life, to develop the ability
to tell apart &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/">the&lt;/a>

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton">Badminton&lt;/a>. In the beginning it is
quite odd to understand its finesse, but after a while it gets easily
internalized and becomes quite natural.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can play it in singles or in doubles. Arguably most of the fun happens when
playing in doubles. You&amp;rsquo;re supposed to develop synergy with your court partner
and understand their play style, and then adapt accordingly. The style need not
be immutable: it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine (and common, even) to change tactics as the
game progresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love how I can express myself freely in the court, whilst have little regard
to formal expectations. I can comfortably (and on-demand) change hands, jump,
squat, put either foot forward, serve the shuttle short or long, position myself
close to the center or close to the edge of the court, go left and right or
backwards and forward. The sky is the limit for freedom and creativity of
movements. It&amp;rsquo;s like a dance wherein you get fully immersed, borderline poetic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Few sports give you this much freedom to express yourself as you see fit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unemployment is not the problem</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/unemployment-is-not-the-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:09:38 +0100</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/unemployment-is-not-the-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://whynothugo.nl/journal/2025/03/27/unemployment-is-not-the-problem/">Unemployment is not the problem&lt;/a> by Hugo Barrera:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Modern society faces a paradox: the more efficient we become, the fewer
workers we need to sustain ourselves. Yet we still demand that people work
long hours just to earn survival. If 50 people working full-time can produce
enough for 100, why do we deny the other 50 access to those goods—instead of
letting all 100 work half the hours and share the benefits?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if we already produce enough, why must we keep labouring like we don&amp;rsquo;t?
The real disincentive is forcing unemployment on some while overworking others
in a system that, by its own efficiency, has made so many jobs unnecessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution isn&amp;rsquo;t to invent useless busywork or cling to outdated 40-hour
weeks—it&amp;rsquo;s to distribute necessary labor fairly. A shorter work week wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
mean less gets done; it would mean what must get done is made by the work of
all, freeing time for life beyond work. The obstacle isn&amp;rsquo;t economics, but our
insistence that survival must be earned through toil, even when toil is no
longer needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We humans are little complicated beings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AI uprising or not, first we need to figure out ourselves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Festering</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/festering/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 16:53:10 +0100</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/festering/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://joshuawold.com/lingering-emails/">Festering&lt;/a> by Joshua Wold (via &lt;a href="https://email-is-good.com/2025/03/24/festering/">Chris

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The open source sphere has continuously had a lot of discussion regarding
packaging, and there&amp;rsquo;s often an expectation that upstream developers should
distribution packages. I want to make it clear where I stand on this, what
users of my projects can expect, and what how packagers can contribute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s usually too much work for me (an most upstream developers) to
provide these packages. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Debian and Fedora. I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with
all the quirks of rpm and deb. Even if I take the time to build these, I&amp;rsquo;ll be
shipping a packages for platforms that I don&amp;rsquo;t use. There would be zero
quality control. And that additional work is not something for which I want to
sign up. I want to focus on maintaining upstream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve nothing against others packaging my tools for different
platforms. In fact, I encourage it! If someone with the right expertise wants
to build a Debian package for caffeine-ng, darkman, vdirsyncer or any other
project, I welcome the effort. My focus is on shipping releases ready to be
packaged, and let packagers do their jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, if any packager finds obstacles, or needs to apply patches for
code to build on a given platform, please open an issue (or send a patch). I
don&amp;rsquo;t mind giving guidance. But don&amp;rsquo;t expect me to know all the quirks of
every distribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As a packager myself, from my perspective, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s stance on the topic is the
most desirable possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working with upstream can sometimes drain your energy and motivation to
contribute. Having developers be open and friendly is one of the best ways to
ensure the gears of open source keep working smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish we had less fragmentation. When you go to
&lt;a href="https://repology.org/">Repology&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch&lt;/a>, it
feels so tiresome to see so many projects, distributions and package managers in
the wild. Diversity and choice are positive, but they come with a non-trivial
cost of reinventing the wheel and (re)doing everything over and over again. Life
is already short, and yet so much of it is spent repackaging the same software a
dozen times for a myriad of &lt;code>.deb&lt;/code> or &lt;code>.rpm&lt;/code> flavours, let alone all the indie /
independent ones. Politics yields a feedback loop that weakens open source and
unity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Goodreads</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/goodreads/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 17:53:54 +0100</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/goodreads/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the most joyful aspects of using the internet is to &lt;del>stalk&lt;/del> keep track

Friction:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Right now we live lives of incredible convenience. Everything that comes out
is designed to introduce more and more instant gratification. And that&amp;rsquo;s a
really nice thing… to a point.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I see so many stories of people, daily, talking about how people (especially
students) today have worse and worse attention spans and patience than ever
before, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s the result of our world working as designed. We&amp;rsquo;ve
made people addicted to instantly getting the object they want, the food they
want, the information they want, the answers they want, to the point of them
not being willing to do their own research or wait just a bit longer for…
anything. We&amp;rsquo;re lazy about seeking answers and unhappy with having to wait for
results. We can&amp;rsquo;t be bored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway. I think we could all benefit from a bit more friction in our lives,
whether it&amp;rsquo;s via boycotting something, adding limits to something, cutting
something out entirely, or just stepping back before letting ourselves succumb
to the addictive feeds of the world. There&amp;rsquo;s strength in numbers, so if you
don&amp;rsquo;t mind the call to action: Let&amp;rsquo;s work on that, together!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s somewhat of a meta application here as well: blogging comes with its own
friction. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly harder than tweeting or posting a story or a status
update.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Micromarriages</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/micromarriages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 21:13:09 +0100</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/micromarriages/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters/micromarriages/">Russel Blickhan&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In risk analysis, a one-in-a-million chance of death is called a micromort. A
skydiving jump, for instance, gives you 8 micromorts; you have about an
8-in-a-million chance of dying each time. The more jumps you do, the more
micromorts you accrue. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be skydiving every week, then maybe
you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t also scale Everest, which is apparently 37,932 micromorts per
ascent.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Micromarriages are the same concept, applied to dating. Any given event gives
you some chance in a million of meeting a life partner. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking
for a life partner, you should optimize for micromarriages. Maybe swiping on a
dating app gets you one micromarriage per swipe. Maybe going to a party where
you don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone except the host gets you a few dozens micromarriages.
Actually going on a date has to be at least few hundred micromarriages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s serendipity, in its simplest and purest form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps I should coin the term &lt;em>microserendipity&lt;/em> to denote &amp;ldquo;bits of
serendipity&amp;rdquo; according to a given event.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can intentionally increase your exposure to micromarriages. You should go
to that party where you don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone except the host, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t
really feel like it. You should try a new hobby where you&amp;rsquo;ll meet new people,
like improv or a run club. You should cultivate relationships with at least a
few socialites that will invite you to large events.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most people overrate the number of micromarriages from dating apps and
underrate the number of micromarriages from in-person events. People you meet
in person already share some context — they&amp;rsquo;re at the same event, after all.
Starting a conversation in person pre-filters for whether you get along. This
doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to involve matchmaking by your friends; simply going to more
things in person will increase your micromarriages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Some food for thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, a friend recently introduced me to the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_cute">meet
cute&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A meet cute is a scene in media, in which two people meet for the first time,
typically under unusual, humorous, or cute circumstances, and go on to form a
future romantic couple.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a small philosophy I have about the internet:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe that it&amp;rsquo;s my duty to publish the answer to previously-unanswered
questions. That way, the next person who comes along has an easier time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hell yes!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For example, I was once trying to figure out how to skip the first line of a
CSV file in Python. When I did a web search for &amp;ldquo;python skip first line of
CSV&amp;rdquo;, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few minutes, I figured it out myself. Then, I wrote a &lt;a href="https://evanhahn.com/python-skip-header-csv-reader/">quick blog
post&lt;/a> explaining my
solution…and now it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most popular posts on my site! Even though
the post only took a few minutes to write, it&amp;rsquo;s been one of my most viewed
over the last decade, (presumably) because so many people are trying to do the
exact same thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2025/02/crawling-/-indexing-is-wild/">Hell yes!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Of course, this is a guideline, not a rule. Sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t feel very
confident in my answer and don&amp;rsquo;t want to publish bogus information. Sometimes
I&amp;rsquo;m busy and don&amp;rsquo;t have time for a writeup, especially for more complex stuff.
And sometimes, nobody cares—how to compute a CRC32 checksum in Crystal has not
been a big hit; I might have wasted my time with that one.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And fair enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time is limited, after all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>YOLO: debug only after push</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/yolo-debug-only-after-push/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 15:16:57 +0100</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/yolo-debug-only-after-push/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whenever writing new posts in this blog I rarely preview them in advance,

&lt;li>&lt;code>git push&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>ONLY then&lt;/em>, &lt;code>just&lt;/code>, open web browser, see if it looks OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does it &lt;em>NOT&lt;/em> look OK (grammar errors, markdown issues, typos)? Make a quick
