&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In risk analysis, a one-in-a-million chance of death is called a micromort. A
skydiving jump, for instance, gives you 8 micromorts; you have about an
8-in-a-million chance of dying each time. The more jumps you do, the more
micromorts you accrue. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be skydiving every week, then maybe
you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t also scale Everest, which is apparently 37,932 micromorts per
ascent.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Micromarriages are the same concept, applied to dating. Any given event gives
you some chance in a million of meeting a life partner. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking
for a life partner, you should optimize for micromarriages. Maybe swiping on a
dating app gets you one micromarriage per swipe. Maybe going to a party where
you don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone except the host gets you a few dozens micromarriages.
Actually going on a date has to be at least few hundred micromarriages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s serendipity, in its simplest and purest form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps I should coin the term &lt;em>microserendipity&lt;/em> to denote &amp;ldquo;bits of
serendipity&amp;rdquo; according to a given event.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You can intentionally increase your exposure to micromarriages. You should go
to that party where you don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone except the host, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t
really feel like it. You should try a new hobby where you&amp;rsquo;ll meet new people,
like improv or a run club. You should cultivate relationships with at least a
few socialites that will invite you to large events.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most people overrate the number of micromarriages from dating apps and
underrate the number of micromarriages from in-person events. People you meet
in person already share some context — they&amp;rsquo;re at the same event, after all.
Starting a conversation in person pre-filters for whether you get along. This
doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to involve matchmaking by your friends; simply going to more
things in person will increase your micromarriages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Some food for thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, a friend recently introduced me to the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_cute">meet
cute&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A meet cute is a scene in media, in which two people meet for the first time,
typically under unusual, humorous, or cute circumstances, and go on to form a
future romantic couple.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a small philosophy I have about the internet:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe that it&amp;rsquo;s my duty to publish the answer to previously-unanswered
questions. That way, the next person who comes along has an easier time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hell yes!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For example, I was once trying to figure out how to skip the first line of a
CSV file in Python. When I did a web search for &amp;ldquo;python skip first line of
CSV&amp;rdquo;, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few minutes, I figured it out myself. Then, I wrote a &lt;a href="https://evanhahn.com/python-skip-header-csv-reader/">quick blog
post&lt;/a> explaining my
solution…and now it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most popular posts on my site! Even though
the post only took a few minutes to write, it&amp;rsquo;s been one of my most viewed
over the last decade, (presumably) because so many people are trying to do the
exact same thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2025/02/crawling-/-indexing-is-wild/">Hell yes!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Of course, this is a guideline, not a rule. Sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t feel very
confident in my answer and don&amp;rsquo;t want to publish bogus information. Sometimes
I&amp;rsquo;m busy and don&amp;rsquo;t have time for a writeup, especially for more complex stuff.
And sometimes, nobody cares—how to compute a CRC32 checksum in Crystal has not
been a big hit; I might have wasted my time with that one.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And fair enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time is limited, after all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>YOLO: debug only after push</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/yolo-debug-only-after-push/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 15:16:57 +0100</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/03/yolo-debug-only-after-push/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whenever writing new posts in this blog I rarely preview them in advance,
especially when they are short and simple&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My rushed workflow is roughly:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>open a new terminal tab / window&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>cd ~blog&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>just new &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>vim content/posts&lt;/code>, hit &amp;lsquo;G&amp;rsquo;, hit &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo;, hit &amp;lsquo;ENTER&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>draft the post&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>:Gwq&lt;/code> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive&lt;/a>, &lt;code>git&lt;/code>
integration)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>git commit -m &amp;quot;new post: hello world&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>git push&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>ONLY then&lt;/em>, &lt;code>just&lt;/code>, open web browser, see if it looks OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does it &lt;em>NOT&lt;/em> look OK (grammar errors, markdown issues, typos)? Make a quick
edit, &lt;code>:Gwq&lt;/code> again, &lt;code>git amend &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push -f&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally this process happens faster than the CI pipeline takes to build and
subsequently publish the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No AI involved™, not even a spellchecker&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

BigTech&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to work in the same company as the author of the post&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and yet I
followed a completely different approach than him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do I have credibility? You don&amp;rsquo;t have to take my word for granted, and you
should make your own conclusions. The only transparency bit I&amp;rsquo;ll reveal is that
I got promoted from Junior (L3) to Mid (L4) within 1.5 year, and from Mid to
Senior (L5) within 2 years i.e. 3.5 years total to become Senior. Enough
&lt;del>humblebragging&lt;/del> boasting already, let&amp;rsquo;s do a rebuttal of the post. Just one
disclaimer: although it&amp;rsquo;s framed as a rebuttal, it&amp;rsquo;s important to acknowledge
that no two experiences are the same, and two truths can be simultaneously
valid.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Become the person everyone in my working radius knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is important, but only if you&amp;rsquo;re well-known for good things™. Sometimes
it&amp;rsquo;s better to stay in the shadow. That said, there&amp;rsquo;s virtually no downside to
being well-known if your impact is generally and non-controversially positive.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Learn how a big org works, and learn to be effective in them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is very important. Knowledge is power. Everything is a game. Sometimes (not
always, but oftentimes) the game is political. Learning the rules of engagement
of the game can only bring clarity and perspective to making one play the game
more effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Eventually be in the room that leaders make decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is important if you&amp;rsquo;re Senior+. As a Junior or as a Mid Engineer, I would
argue, this is actually worse. Engaging in politics in an early career phase is
disastrous, it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of behavior that quickly degrades one&amp;rsquo;s motivation
and/or enthusiasm and/or passion&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> for building / evolving the product.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>here&amp;rsquo;s what I learned you need: Visibility. Visibility Visibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Again, more visibility is better than less (or no) visibility, but only when the
visibility is good. This point is debatable.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Be where leaders are.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t see the point. Again, staying away from politics is important to
maintain enthusiasm, especially during early years. If you chase leaders (too)
soon, you&amp;rsquo;ll be dragged down in the sea of despair. I believe this is good
advice &lt;em>only&lt;/em> when you&amp;rsquo;re Senior+.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Look where leaders are looking.
Don&amp;rsquo;t work on things you think are important.
Don&amp;rsquo;t work on things your users think are important.
Work on things leadership thinks are important.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is where our paths (significantly) diverge. There are two schools of
thought: one is to
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boot-licking">appeal&lt;/a>
&lt;em>directly&lt;/em> to those who have the powers to promote you; the other one is to do
what&amp;rsquo;s best for your personal growth, aligned with your interests, whilst
keeping in mind the prioritization and direction of the project you&amp;rsquo;re working
on. Following the former route is akin to applying the advice from &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1303.The_48_Laws_of_Power">48 Laws of
Power by Robert
Greene&lt;/a>.
Following the latter is akin to following &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38900866-it-doesn-t-have-to-be-crazy-at-work">It Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Crazy at Work
by David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason
Fried&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel my opinion on the matter is quite clear. Nonetheless, it&amp;rsquo;s still
crucial to do something useful. Moving the needle in the right direction every
day (or even every hour&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>!) is a great way to stay in touch with reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sound the alarm bells, often.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create a problem, become the hero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think there&amp;rsquo;s an important thing that needs to be solved, DON&amp;rsquo;T do it
silently. Make it a priority. Get leadership on board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And only then come in and save the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh no, please don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sounding alarm bells often is good e.g. in the form of filing tickets /
reporting bugs frequently. Very few people have the enthusiasm to do so. Being
one of them makes you stand out, full stop. Investing in ways to make it easier
and quicker to report high-quality bugs is worthwhile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, if you happen to tackle these very same bugs, that gives you visibility.
Good visibility. And good visibility is great!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t create problems though. Don&amp;rsquo;t be a hero. In fact: go/no-heroes&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding silence: In general, not every single issue one resolves needs to be
echoed everywhere. This is often perceived as bragging, which is not great. It&amp;rsquo;s
important to keep your manager well-informed (e.g. during weekly 1:1s, and/or in
a document that accumulates all your accomplishments). And it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to
have your teammates and close leadership aware of your strengths and overall
accomplishments. That said, sometimes impact is realized in a bigger fashion
when accomplishments are done in the shadows.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It isn&amp;rsquo;t your work - it&amp;rsquo;s the perception of your work that&amp;rsquo;s important.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We are all humans. This is one of our cognitive biases. Can&amp;rsquo;t disagree with that
statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Work with as many people as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I must digress. Quality triumphs quantity. Exceptions: 20% projects, citizenship
initiatives like readability review, mentoring, tech talks, etc. For core work,
this is not important.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The more people support you, the higher your chances that you&amp;rsquo;re able to pull
your weight in getting things done.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Unless you play a political role or something that involves elections or a
popularity contest, having lots of people supporting you doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter.
Nevertheless, having the right / important people support you does.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Have a highly capable manager, who is great at representing you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>1000x agreed. To this date, I am grateful (and lucky&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>!) to always have had
great managers. This makes a huge difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This means they understand what you do thoroughly, and they&amp;rsquo;re a great
salesperson. Your manager represents you during promotion committee rounds
where they convince others why you have to get promoted. If your manager isn&amp;rsquo;t
a great salesperson, you have to make sure others know you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>+1.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Getting promoted at BigTech is one of those areas in life that isn&amp;rsquo;t based on
merit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hard work ≠ reward. The &amp;ldquo;smart work&amp;rdquo; that actually gets you promoted isn&amp;rsquo;t
about pushing your project forward; it&amp;rsquo;s about pushing yourself forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>s/BigTech/Tech&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or, even: s/BigTech/any company whatsoever&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only bit I&amp;rsquo;ll add: motivation / passion / enthusiasm does matter, and makes
a huge difference. That&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another post though.&lt;/p>

fix it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I wrote a manuscript on paper. It is like magic&amp;hellip;writing with a pen. Slowly.
Technology, in the last couple of years, has made me lose the sense of pleasure
in doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Surely there&amp;rsquo;s no erase feature but, somehow, my mind feels intrinsically
connected with the paper. The ink, as it flows, relieves tension and retains
intent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of it was intentional though. LaTeX is my favorite digital way to feel
intimate with virtual fonts and pixels. And it&amp;rsquo;s faster to type in a keyboard
than to write with a pen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crawling / indexing is wild</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/02/crawling-/-indexing-is-wild/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 11:49:41 +0100</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/02/crawling-/-indexing-is-wild/</guid><description>&lt;p>One little anecdote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week I bookmarked &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vertical+pod+autoscaler+argocd+sync+loop&amp;amp;ia=web">this query&lt;/a> on DuckDuckGo&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>vertical pod autoscaler argocd sync loop&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Eventually I resolved the issue and wrote a &lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2025/02/argocd-vertical-pod-autoscaler-sync-loop/">blog post&lt;/a> about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I clicked the bookmark accidentally (I forgot to delete it last week).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For my delighted surprise, the blog post I had written was the top #1 result on
DuckDuckGo. I was curious to check it on Google, and it&amp;rsquo;s the top result
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=vertical%20pod%20autoscaler%20argocd%20sync%20loop">there&lt;/a>
as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s so&amp;hellip;&lt;em>cool&lt;/em>! Especially because it was totally unexpected.&lt;/p>

for you.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s in a conference room, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s free-floating by the desk areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Either way, when you decide to take notes, consider adding your name and a date
next to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s good courtesy, and could help the next person decide whether to erase your
notes. Old notes are more forgiving to be erased, whereas recent notes (e.g.
from this week) may warrant double-asking their author.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tend to treat my whiteboard notes as throwaway. When they are important, I
snap a picture (in case someone deletes them), &lt;em>and&lt;/em> write: &amp;ldquo;DO NOT ERASE UNTIL
YYYY-MM-DD&amp;rdquo;. Otherwise, assume it&amp;rsquo;s fair game to lose them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What to write in the whiteboard?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, don&amp;rsquo;t write anything that is private. It is common sense, but the concept
of private is subjective. You probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t write personal notes, however
confidential information could also be deemed as private in this context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to brainstorm with different pencil marker colors. Draw diagrams, mind
maps, arrows. Arrows everywhere. Scaffold my TODO list for the week. Visualize
all my pending and upcoming tasks, then prioritize a subset of them. Have the
pleasure to &lt;del>strike through&lt;/del> completed tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It enriches the office experience, especially when you have your own whiteboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LinkedIn: chronological view</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/02/linkedin-chronological-view/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:53:22 +0100</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/02/linkedin-chronological-view/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://preslav.me/2025/01/28/howto-replace-linkedin-algorithmic-timeline/">How to Replace Linkedin&amp;rsquo;s Algorithmic Timeline&lt;/a> by Preslav Rachev:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here is a quick tip on bringing back your sanity when using LinkedIn. Whether
you are familiar with algorithmic timelines work or not, it has certainly come
to your attention that your home feed page is not chronologically organized.
Instead, you see posts from people and organizations that LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s
content-matching algorithms thought you might be interested in. Those are so
good that you&amp;rsquo;d often catch yourself scrolling, and scrolling, and scrolling,
often, forgetting why you were there in the first place. Not only that but
even if you found something actually worth your attention, LinkedIn will
likely rearrange your feed completely the next time you open the page.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a phenomenon called doomscrolling and is something that most social
media applications make good use of. However, LinkedIn has turned that into
perfection. The goal is no longer to deliver valuable updates from your
professional contacts (which was its original purpose), but just to keep you
engaged and coming back for more.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It turns out it&amp;rsquo;s possible to set the preferred feed / timeline view to &amp;ldquo;Most
recent&amp;rdquo;, instead of the default &amp;ldquo;Most relevant posts (Recommended)&amp;rdquo;. Change the
setting
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/preferred-view">here&lt;/a>. The
link works at the time of the publication of this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit of fresh air, and less
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification&lt;/a>, I would say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t use LinkedIn often. Especially for news, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good place
to become informed&amp;hellip;however, while we&amp;rsquo;re here, if you work in Tech, feel free
to connect with me (my profile is LinkedIn&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> the footer of this site). A cool
&amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo; I learned from a speaker at &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM&lt;/a>: if you write
an avocado emoji in your intro message then I&amp;rsquo;ll (very likely) instantly accept
you the next time I log in (which is not often).&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Expand Calendar &amp;gt; My Schedule&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under &amp;ldquo;Menu bar options &amp;gt; Show Events in menu bar&amp;rdquo;, select &amp;ldquo;1 hour before&amp;rdquo; (or

&lt;p>There were some 250+ posts spawning 10+ years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In no particular order:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>new acquaintances don&amp;rsquo;t need to know about my whole timeline / history / past,
whether it&amp;rsquo;s employment, locations I lived in, locations I travelled to,
activities, hobbies, etc&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>reduce dependence on Big Tech™ (even further)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>effectively eliminate my attachment to the platform. No data, no regrets&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37830765-ten-arguments-for-deleting-your-social-media-accounts-right-now">Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right
Now&lt;/a>
by Jaron Lanier. I read this book 5 years ago (2020) and it always stayed in my head.
I wrote the following review on Goodreads at the time:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Decent read for this century overall, but the book is quite repetitive. The
author repeats the BUMMER acronym a lot, it&amp;rsquo;s quite annoying. But his
arguments are relevant and decent to some extent. One thing that misses the
point is that the author treats social media as a blackbox, you&amp;rsquo;re either in
or out. There&amp;rsquo;s no middle ground. There are some gray zone use cases that
are useful and aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily manipulative. Marketplace and
community-based Discussion Groups are two of them. Still, if you consume
personalized newsfeeds or stories on a daily basis then
you should definitely read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t believe you need to be that much radical or strict to the point of
completely getting rid of them, nonetheless it&amp;rsquo;s not particularly difficult to
achieve a healthy balance either. Personally, I deactivate my account for weeks
or months at a time ephemerally, and this tends to work well for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>focus more on the present. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep looking back at my social
media posts if there are no posts to look back to in the first place. This
fosters a healthy feedback loop wherein incentives to live in the present are
continuously rewarded&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>privacy!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>more incentive to direct resources towards platforms I care more about
(e.g. this blog!) – opportunity cost&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>intentionally eliminate most of the friction I had to share my private account
with new acquaintances&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a side effect, I added a link to my profile at the footer of this site.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not 100% correct as I left only one post, which doubles down as (i)
nostalgia / melancholy for the good ol&amp;rsquo; times and (ii) verification /

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t being updated
any longer. &amp;ldquo;Last seen NN days ago&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I deleted it from my Apple account. It&amp;rsquo;s the
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn2FB1P_Mn8">universal&lt;/a> way to fix issues,
right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far so good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pair it up again. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work no matter how many times
I tried to remove its battery, nor how many times I&amp;rsquo;d swap its battery for
another one. I gave up for a couple of days (weeks?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I realized that my iPhone kept notifying me that an AirTag had been
following me. Huh?! I thought it was referring to the AirTag of the friends I
was travelling with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That kept occurring even after the trip was over. Then I had a sudden
realization: duh, it&amp;rsquo;s my own AirTag. And yet, it&amp;rsquo;s not showing up in &amp;ldquo;Find My&amp;rdquo;.
Somehow it got stuck in a odd state that iOS was thinking it was someone else&amp;rsquo;s
AirTag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that point I got an epiphany: is it possible to &amp;ldquo;hard reset&amp;rdquo; it, just like a
router? It turns out the answer is
&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102577">yes&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how to reset your AirTag:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press down on the polished stainless steel battery cover of your AirTag and rotate counterclockwise until the cover stops rotating.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Remove the cover and the battery.*&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Replace the battery.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press down on the battery until you hear a sound. This sound means that the battery is connected.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When the sound finishes, repeat the process four more times, removing and replacing the battery, then pressing down on the battery until you hear a sound. You should hear a sound each time you press on the battery, for a total of five sounds. The fifth sound is different from the previous four. This indicates that the AirTag is now ready to pair.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Replace the cover by aligning the three tabs on the cover with the three slots on your AirTag.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press down on the cover.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Rotate the cover clockwise until it stops rotating.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Upon following the above procedure, the fifth time yielded a different sound.
Then, almost immediately, my iPhone prompted me to connect to it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The standards of courtesy and hospitality vary wildly from subculture to
subculture, locale to locale, person to person. What you offer your friends is
your own business, but in this article we use survey data to explore what

&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people feel that letting someone crash on a couch for a few nights lies
well within the boundaries of good old fashioned hospitality. After that,
things get less clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After five nights, 45 percent would already be expecting some form of payment,

&lt;p>Note the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do not download SmartTube from any app store, APK websites or blogs; these

&lt;p>If you come for at least 7 days and intend to use public transit (which is
&lt;em>excellent&lt;/em>!) &lt;em>and&lt;/em> travel to outside the city center e.g. to do some
sightseeing and/or hiking, you should &lt;em>probably&lt;/em> get the &lt;a href="https://www.bahn.de/angebot/regio/deutschland-ticket">Deutschland
Ticket&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DL-Ticket is purely for public transit. It&amp;rsquo;s not a CityCard for a CityPass
or similar i.e. no access to museums and/or other attractions. Such a card
&lt;a href="https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/tickets-and-fares/tickets-daytickets/muenchen-card/index.html">exists&lt;/a>,
but I cannot vouch for it at this time. I have the impression it&amp;rsquo;s only worth it
if you intend to pack &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> of activities within a shorter period of 2-5 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DL-Ticket used to cost 49€ per month until December 2024. Since January 2025
it costs 58€ per month (a ~15% increase).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is this a lot? I can give you some data points for Munich, Bavaria:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A weekly ticket within the main zone (&amp;lsquo;M&amp;rsquo;) in Munich costs ~20€.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A one-way ticket from the airport costs (zone &amp;lsquo;M-5&amp;rsquo;) ~15€&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Therefore&lt;/strong>: Two one-way airport tickets + one weekly ticket equals 50€.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Another data point: a Munich monthly ticket within zone &amp;lsquo;M&amp;rsquo; costs ~68€.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not an exhaustive list of all possibilities to get tickets: it&amp;rsquo;s also
possible to buy group tickets by pooling people together so that the total can be even
cheaper. However, it can get complicated quite fast, and it&amp;rsquo;s likely not worth
the vacation stress to stay on top of German bureaucracy. This is why I would
recommend to simply get the DL-Ticket, without thinking too much, if you&amp;rsquo;ll stay
for 7+ days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit of the DL-Ticket is that it allows you to take pretty much
(almost) &lt;em>any&lt;/em> public transit within Germany. The previously mentioned monthly
ticket within the zone &amp;lsquo;M&amp;rsquo; in Munich is only valid within certain parts of
Munich. The DL-Ticket, on the other hand, is valid in Berlin, Frankfurt,
Hamburg, Dresden&amp;hellip;that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s much more cost-effective (and simpler!) than
fiddling with other ticket combinations. And this includes going for
long-distance regional train trips departing from Munich.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is &amp;ldquo;public transit&amp;rdquo;? In Germany, it&amp;rsquo;s split into local transit (&amp;ldquo;ÖPNV&amp;rdquo;) and
long-distance transit (&amp;ldquo;Fernverkehr&amp;rdquo;). In my definition:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Local transit:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>S-Bahn = surface trains (S1, S2, S3, &amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>U-Bahn = underground / subway / metro (U1, U2, U3, &amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Straßenbahn = tram = light rail = street cars (these have numbers e.g. 12, 16,
17)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bus (these have numbers: e.g. 53, 153)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Long-distance transit:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Regional trains: go from a city to another (RB, RE)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inter-city express trains: same, but faster and skipping many cities along the
way. These are often dubbed &amp;ldquo;ICs&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ICEs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Regional trains (e.g. RE6) are &lt;em>in general&lt;/em> included within the DL-Ticket. There
are &lt;a href="https://int.bahn.de/en/faq/deutschlandticket-which-trains">exceptions&lt;/a>
though (this is &lt;em>bureaucratic&lt;/em> Germany!):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Deutschland-Ticket can be used throughout Germany on all local trains such
as RB, RE, S-Bahn trains (SPNV) and also on public transport such as buses,
trams, subways, etc. (ÖPNV) of the participating state tariffs, transit
authorities and transport companies in accordance with the area of validity
and their conditions for any number of journeys. This applies regardless of
which transport company, transit authority or national tariff is noted on the
ticket itself. A Deutschland-Ticket purchased in Munich, for example, can
therefore also be used for journeys in Frankfurt and the surrounding area.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Please note, however, that the Deutschland-Ticket is generally not valid on
trains operated by DB Fernverkehr AG or other long-distance providers such as
FlixTrain (e.g. IC, EC, ICE, but also RE of DB Fernverkehr AG). DB Fernverkehr
is currently in talks with the federal states and local transport authorities
about exceptions on certain sections of the route.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Consult the link above, which contains &lt;a href="https://assets.static-bahn.de/dam/jcr:35c032ce-e559-4b4d-82ce-ce207d374b45/20231221_Geltungsbereich-D-Ticket.pdf">this
PDF&lt;/a>,
to be 100% sure. Or just keep it simple: accept that ~98% (citation needed) of
all available regional trains are within scope, and hope for the best&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that you were fully convinced to purchase a DL-Ticket, assuming that you
didn&amp;rsquo;t already regret trying to understand the rules, how do you get one in the
first place?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could get it physically, but no one&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> does that. You cannot get one from a
ticket machine. You should get it digitally, and then it becomes available in
your phone. If you get inspected then you just show a QR code from your phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two practical ways I would suggest to get it digitally:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://deutschland-ticket.store/autobus-oberbayern?lang=en">AutoBus
Oberbayern&lt;/a>:
It&amp;rsquo;s possible to make it automatically cancel within one month. (&amp;ldquo;Single
ticket only: Your subscription will be cancelled directly, you will receive
only one ticket for the selected month&amp;rdquo;). Normally, the DL-Ticket is a
monthly subscription (&amp;ldquo;Abo&amp;rdquo;), and cancelling it is somewhat of a hassle&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
Foreign credit cards are accepted, as well as SEPA Direct Debit.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.mopla.solutions/">Mopla&lt;/a>: By default it is a monthly
subscription, but it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to pause and/or cancel it. It accepts credit
cards, Apple Pay and PayPal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I would recommend 1) for guests with a short stay and 2) for people who would
stay in Germany for a longer period (e.g. a few months). Some people I know who
&lt;em>live&lt;/em> in Germany also opt for 2), instead of a more traditional Deutsche Bahn
(DB) or MVG subscription, because Mopla makes it trivial to pause the
subscription at any time, whilst other providers require you to time your
cancellation before a specific cut-off day (typically the 10th day of the
previous month) before it gets automatically renewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One caveat of Mopla: it &lt;em>seems&lt;/em> you need to have your App Store set to Germany
in order to use its app. I could not verify that personally, but see the
&lt;a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/deutschland-ticket">source&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least: the validity of the DL-Ticket counts on a per calendar month
basis, i.e. January 2025, February 2025, and so on. If you&amp;rsquo;re arriving, say, on
Jan 28th, then you&amp;rsquo;re out of luck. It&amp;rsquo;s not possible to make it count for &amp;ldquo;30
days from now&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the information above isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, I suggest to read up more on &lt;a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/deutschland-ticket">All About
Berlin&lt;/a> which summarizes
it better than I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ah, and what if you only visit for only a few days, less than a week? Then the
best cost-benefit really depends, and it&amp;rsquo;s harder to make a general
recommendation. I would be happy to make a suggestion depending on the amount of
people, how you are arriving (e.g. main train station versus main airport), when
(time of day) you are arriving, and what are your travel plans.&lt;/p>

zone range, which is the one you need to complement to get to the Munich
city center from the MUC airport. Therefore, to be pedantic, the total cost
would actually be ~(9€ + 9€ + 20€) = ~38€.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Pare de receber ligações de telemarketing das Empresas participantes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>O Não Me Perturbe permite, de forma fácil e gratuita, evitar a oferta de
produtos e serviços por meio de contato telefônico provenientes exclusivamente
das Prestadoras de Serviços de Telecomunicações (Telefone móvel, telefone
fixo, TV por assinatura e Internet) e pelas Instituições Financeiras
(operações de Empréstimo Consignado e Cartão de Crédito Consignado).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Na prática: cadastre seu número de celular (+55) + CPF na plataforma, além de
email + senha para gerenciá-la.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Em troca, chamadas automáticas de operatoras de telefonia, bancos, entre outras
empresas irão (teoricamente&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>) parar de realizar chamadas de telemarketing (spam!)
para o seu número.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uma vez cadastrado, o processo leva até 30 dias para ser efetivado.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Também descobri&lt;/strong>: como identificar &lt;a href="https://qualempresameligou.com.br/">qual empresa me
ligou?&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel) determinou a criação de uma
ferramenta, que é o Portal &amp;ldquo;Qual empresa me ligou?&amp;rdquo;
(&lt;a href="https://qualempresameligou.com.br/)">https://qualempresameligou.com.br/)&lt;/a>, com o objetivo de identificar o CNPJ e a
Razão Social associados a determinados números de telefone. Assim, caso você
receba chamada de um número que desconheça, e este pertencer a uma Pessoa
Jurídica, poderá identificar a empresa que te ligou.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn:1">
&lt;p>Caso as empresas continuem violando o seu direito, mesmo após a inclusão
na lista, é possível realizar uma reclamação na própria plataforma.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Remember when every company rushed to make an app? Airlines, restaurants, even

But fast-forward to today, and browsers can do all that. Yet businesses still

&lt;p>One of my favorite old Linux jokes is, &amp;ldquo;Linux is free… if your time is
worthless.&amp;rdquo; This quote is possibly adapted from a jwz interview dating back to
1998. In it, he said:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I think Linux is a great thing, because Linux is an alternative to [major
operating systems], and because, of all the operating systems that are at
all relevant today, Unix is the best of a bad lot. […] As we all know, Linux
is only free if your time has no value, and I find that my time is better
spent doing things other than the endless moving-target-upgrade dance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Snark aside, that&amp;rsquo;s a good read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ever since &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/">&amp;ldquo;Cloud Native&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> became mainstream, developer
userspace tools became more valuable than whatever OS flavour you choose to run.
So pick &lt;a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/on-virtue-signalling">whichever you like&lt;/a>,
work hard, and have fun.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>I always include the names of the people who created the content I am
linking to, if I can figure that out. Credit is really important, and it&amp;rsquo;s
also useful for myself because I can later search for someone&amp;rsquo;s name and
find other interesting things they have created that I linked to in the
past. If I&amp;rsquo;ve linked to someone&amp;rsquo;s work three or more times I also try to
notice and upgrade them to a dedicated tag.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>A slightly self-involved concern I have is that I like to prove that I&amp;rsquo;ve
read it. This is more for me than for anyone else: I don&amp;rsquo;t like to recommend
something if I&amp;rsquo;ve not read that thing myself, and sticking in a detail that
shows I read past the first paragraph helps keep me honest about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I try to add something extra. My goal with any link blog post is that if you
read both my post and the source material you&amp;rsquo;ll have an enhanced experience
over if you read just the source material itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Every step of the way, I found myself nodding my head, thinking to myself, I
do that too! — right down to creating tags for people after I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned
their work or simply credited their bylines a few times. (The difference is
that Willison seemingly isn&amp;rsquo;t a procrastinator, and I am, so my decades of
tagging aren&amp;rsquo;t yet exposed to anyone but me.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Personally I think that running a link blog is exhausting: there are just soooo
many links, and they are a never-ending spiral.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, choosing to blog instead of, say, &lt;em>tweet&lt;/em>, adds a certain
degree of friction in such a way that you tend to implicitly cherry-pick the
links that are more relevant and/or important to you, given the opportunity
cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unsplash: Wallpapers</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2025/01/unsplash-wallpapers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 20:06:08 -0300</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2025/01/unsplash-wallpapers/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="https://getfullyear.com/">new year&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>You know you are reading a great book when you constantly stop and identify
yourself with one of the characters, or perhaps with all of them,
understanding their unique personality traits, intimate thoughts, deep wishes

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Something that that a few of my teams have done well is introducing themselves
asynchronously. It can be a hard thing to do! When you&amp;rsquo;re on a fully remote
team and you&amp;rsquo;re seeing everyone&amp;rsquo;s face on Zoom for the first time, it&amp;rsquo;s a
little nerve-wracking to figure out how to present yourself, how to &amp;ldquo;bring
your whole self to work,&amp;rdquo; and not be a total weirdo.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What my team at GitHub does (and what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen at a few other orgs now, it&amp;rsquo;s
catching on!) is we have a repository of &amp;ldquo;Human User Guides&amp;rdquo; full of details
about each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>User guides (go/user-guides) are a great way to introduce yourself to your team
at work. Cassidy notes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Time zones/availability&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Communication preferences (Slack vs Zoom vs email vs phone vs something else)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Things folks might misunderstand about you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Things everyone should know&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How you prefer to get feedback&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Things that you like to talk about, work-related and non-work-related&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The list is already quite comprehensive, however I would also add:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://jeanhsu.substack.com/p/ask-vs-guess-culture">Ask vs Guess&lt;/a>
preferences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://perrotta.dev/2024/12/mbti/">MBTI&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>One caveat is maintenance&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Information could easily get outdated. It&amp;rsquo;s
possible to write your user guide in such a way it represents a snapshot of your
preferences at the time you wrote it, OR as a living document that keeps
evolving as you grow. Adjust expectations clearly. One way to do so is to add a
date to it in case you anticipate information easily getting out-of-date
therein.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, why stop there? Set up oneshot 1:1 meetings with your immediate team
members, and then with your extended ones. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether these
meetings are in-person or virtual. Set up serendipitous meetings with folks
outside of your team&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Some people call these lunch ninjas, others call these
&lt;a href="https://www.donut.com/">coffee donuts&lt;/a>. Not everyone may end up accepting your
invitations, but that&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine! Just move on.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Alt in this context stands for &amp;ldquo;alternate account&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>TIL what a digital mending circle is.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What, you ask, is a digital mending circle? A virtual co-working session for
the kinds of oft-neglected maintenance tasks that accrue around our digital
lives. Instead of darning socks and patching jeans, we update personal
websites, delete unused accounts, work on side projects, or even just catch up
on email.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this ever since forever. December is always a great month to do
so, as it&amp;rsquo;s quiet and uneventful&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest issue is that going through cruft often reveals even more cruft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A typical example: going through a list of bookmarks (or &amp;ldquo;read it later&amp;rdquo; items)
will often generate even more links to sift through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MBTI</title><link>https://perrotta.dev/2024/12/mbti/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 02:45:11 -0300</pubDate><author>serendipity@perrotta.dev (Thiago Perrotta)</author><guid>https://perrotta.dev/2024/12/mbti/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://dynomight.net/mbti/">https://dynomight.net/mbti/&lt;/a> has the &amp;ldquo;fastest mbti test&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tendencies&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Introverts (I) direct their energy inwards, to ideas and thoughts. Extroverts (E) direct their energy outwards, towards people, things, and situations.
Sensing people (S) prefer tangible facts. Intuitive people (N) prefer abstractions and theories.
Feelers (F) look at situations through empathy for the people involved. Thinkers (T) look at situations from a more detached, logical viewpoint.
Judging people (J) prefer a planned and structured approach to life. Perceiving people (P) prefer to be more spontaneous.&lt;/p>

2006 from the late Aaron Swartz:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Some people start their day by reading The New York Times. Others end it by
watching the nightly news. Some get it from The Daily Show. Others download it
from a variety weblogs. Some keep up-to-the-minute by following CNN. Others
have instant news updates automatically text messaged to their phone. But
everybody seems to agree: it&amp;rsquo;s a citizen&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to keep up with the
news. Everybody except me.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I think following the news is a waste of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>None of these stories have relevance to my life. Reading them may be
enjoyable,
but it&amp;rsquo;s an enjoyable waste of time. They will have no impact on my actions one
way or another.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My life does not seem to be impoverished for it; indeed, I think it has been
greatly enhanced. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t found many other people who are willing to
take the plunge.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>How relevant these words of wisdom still are!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been closely following the news ever since the great pandemic™. This
includes social media, apple / google news, and portals from news organizations.
I go out of my way to prevent the constant barrage of unnecessary anxiety and
fearmongering from affecting me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are other ways to stay up-to-date with relevant topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My primary sources are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the excellent &lt;a href="https://miniflux.app/">miniflux&lt;/a>, my beloved RSS reader. As of
the time of this publication, I am following 350+ feeds. Quantity is not an
important metric here, especially as most of these feeds do not publish daily&lt;/li>
&lt;li>local news. These are the most impactful ones, as they affect the environment
where I live and could thus influence or change my short or medium-term
planning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>friends &amp;amp; family, mostly via chat apps through individual conversations or
group chats&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is rarely a need for immediate action. Furthermore the news that are
&lt;em>truly&lt;/em> important or relevant end up spreading like fire, to the point where
it&amp;rsquo;s impossible not to have heard of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Corollary&lt;/strong>: Life is short, make a better use of your time. There are plenty
of ways to do so&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Depending on where you are in Germany, it means exactly one of these:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a truck with ABS brakes (anti-lock braking system)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a Leberkäsesemmel mit ein bisschen Senf&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> – or, if you will, &amp;ldquo;LeberKäsWecken

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Edit&lt;/strong>: And, of course, there&amp;rsquo;s a typo. Because it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to write &lt;code>LKV&lt;/code>
instead of &lt;code>LKW&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Exponential Idle is a math-inspired incremental game available on Android and iOS. Your goal is to stack up money by taking advantage of exponential growth. To do so, you have to step through time by tapping the equation or simply let the time follow its course. You can perform change of variables to accelerate the process, buy upgrades, get rewards, and unlock achievements while earning virtual money.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in love with this game, it is very fun and chill.
The typography is beautiful, with LaTeX equations all over the place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html">Universal Paperclips&lt;/a>, but with an academic&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> tad.&lt;/p>
