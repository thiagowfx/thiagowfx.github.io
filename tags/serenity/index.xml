them.</p>
<p>In this umpteenth iteration of my personal blog, I realized from the start that
I would be much happier by not having any anxiety related to trying to figure
out how many visitors I have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a peace of mind to write just for the sake of writing.</p>
<p>A public blog is not a journal, yet it plays its own role in the grand scheme of
things.</p>
<p>The world would be a happier place if we cared less about numbers; or, at least,
certain numbers, such as Instagram / Twitter / TikTok followers, or story views,
or blog post impressions.</p>
<p>The obvious and most sensible exception is when(ever) you have a business or a
brand. Then it is important to stay in the know, when your revenue depends on
it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Emoji appropriation</title><link>https://www.perrotta.dev/2024/07/emoji-appropriation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 22:39:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.perrotta.dev/2024/07/emoji-appropriation/</guid><description>Sometimes, when you chat with people, you notice that they tend to use a certain (sub)set of emojis frequently. The emoji choice is part of their personality.
After a while, you then start to associate the emoji with the person1, even when it is used in other contexts, by other people.
It is such a powerful association meaning.
Which emoji are you?
Also, some people (millenials?) tend to (over)use emoticons, perhaps even more so than GIFs by Gen-Z.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, when you chat with people, you notice that they tend to use a certain
